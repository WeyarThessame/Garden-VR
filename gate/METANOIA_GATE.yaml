#  METANOIA GATE — Garden Ground State
#
#  This file defines the ethical, attentional, and behavioral
#  climate under which all Garden experiences occur.
#
#  The Gate is not a scene.
#  It is the condition in which scenes are entered.

  description: >
    The Metanoia Gate establishes the Garden’s ground state.
    It removes performance pressure, affirms visitor agency,
    and allows exploration without prescription.
    All scenes inherit this climate.
