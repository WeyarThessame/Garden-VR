name: Coherence Through Presence

intent: >
  Teach presence by allowing the environment to gain or lose coherence
  in response to the user's pacing and attentional signals.

use_when:
  - The scene is a threshold
  - The teaching is experiential, not instructional
  - The future should not resolve until the present is inhabited

signals:
  - movement_speed
  - acceleration
  - pause_duration

interpretation:
  movement_speed: >
    Treated as a semantic signal of presence, not as a challenge or skill metric.
  acceleration: >
    Sudden acceleration is interpreted as loss of presence and destabilizes the scene.
  pause_duration: >
    Sustained stillness stabilizes the environment and allows future elements to resolve.

environment_response:
  destabilize_on_haste: true
  stabilize_on_stillness: true
  coherence_is_continuous: true

constraints:
  - No UI prompts or warnings
  - No explicit success or failure states
  - No rewards or achievements
  - No restoration of dissolved past elements

completion:
  type: recognition
  description: >
    The scene acknowledges presence through environmental coherence
    or a threshold presence, not by declaring success.
