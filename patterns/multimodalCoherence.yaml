name: Multimodal Coherence
type: interaction-pattern

intent:
  Preserve meaning across modalities as capabilities evolve.
  Text, image, sound, and spatial interaction are treated as
  different expressions of the same symbolic source.

constraints:
  - Meaning must not be hard-coded exclusively into a single modality.
  - A scene should have a shared symbolic source (concept, purpose, teaching).
  - Modal representations may change, but coherence must remain.
  - Future tooling should translate meaning, not reinvent it.

appliesTo:
  - scenes
  - image generation
  - narration
  - interaction design
  - future AI-assisted rendering

notes:
  This pattern exists to protect the Garden from fragmentation
  as multimodal capabilities mature. It is declarative, not
  executable, and serves as a guiding constraint rather than
  a runtime rule.
