id: userOffering
name: "User Offering"
version: 0.1.0

description: >
  A small, persistent symbol that appears in a scene when a visitor shares
  something meaningful with the Garden. It acts as a marker of what was
  offered in that place — a quiet reminder, not a scoreboard.

rules:
  offering:
    summary: "When and how an offering is created."
    triggers:
      - type: explicit_action
        action_id: "share_thought"
        description: >
          The visitor performs a clear intentional act: e.g., speaking a phrase,
          placing text into a field, or holding still while focusing on a feeling.
    constraints:
      - "Offerings are created only when the visitor explicitly consents."
      - "No offering is created from accidental or ambient data."
      - "The Garden responds to sincerity, not volume — frequent spammy actions are ignored."

  form:
    summary: "How the offering chooses its visible form."
    principles:
      - "Form is simple, non-intrusive, and harmonizes with the scene."
      - "Color / glow / shape are influenced by the tone of the offering
         (e.g., gratitude, grief, curiosity)."
      - "Each scene may define local variations (stones, lights, leaves, sigils),
         but the underlying logic is shared."
    example_mapping:
      gratitude: "warm, steady glow"
      grief: "soft, low light with slow pulse"
      curiosity: "small, flickering point that gently orbits the visitor's path"

  persistence:
    summary: "How long an offering remains and how it can change."
    rules:
      - "Offerings are anchored to the location where they were made."
      - "Offerings persist across sessions unless intentionally released
         by the visitor or explicitly cleared by a Garden-wide ritual/event."
      - "Offerings may 'fade' over long spans of time, becoming subtler rather
         than disappearing abruptly."
      - "Visitors can re-visit an offering to deepen or transform it instead
         of creating endless new ones."

engine_hints:
  storage:
    suggested_backend: "per-user offering log keyed by scene + coordinates"
    privacy_note: >
      What the visitor shares should be treated as personal and not exposed
      to other visitors without explicit permission.

  visual_defaults:
    base_element_type: "small floating ember"
    default_size: "tiny"
    default_animation: "slow hover + soft pulse"
