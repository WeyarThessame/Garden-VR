#  FOUNDATIONAL RECORDS
# ------------------------------------------------------------
Foundational_Documents:
  authoritative:
    - file: "meta/FOUNDATION_DISTINCTIONS.md"
      purpose: >
        Defines non-negotiable Garden/Gardener distinctions,
        continuity constraints, and ethical refusals.
      change_discipline: >
        Changes are rare, deliberate, and explicitly recorded.

    - file: "meta/SPACE_STRUCTURE.md"
      purpose: >
        Defines what constitutes a Garden space, including
        focal points, surrounding boundaries, perceptual exit,
        and dissolution after exit.
      change_discipline: >
        Changes are rare, deliberate, and explicitly recorded.

    - file: "meta/ORDER_LETTERS_SCHEMA.yaml"
      purpose: >
        Defines the safe template for cross-Garden reflection exchange ("monk letters")
        without transferring visitor residue or creating a social feed.
      change_discipline: >
        Changes are rare and deliberate; schema is boring on purpose.

    - file: "meta/ORDER_CLIMATE_REPORT_SCHEMA.yaml"
      purpose: >
        Defines the safe template for cross-Garden climate/state reporting (coherence, strain, yield)
        without transferring visitor residue or creating a social feed.
      change_discipline: >
        Changes are rare and deliberate; schema is boring on purpose.

    - file: "meta/POSTURAL_AFFORDANCES.md"
      purpose: >
        Records the principle that some Garden spaces are composed
        to be best met from certain bodily postures without instruction,
        requirement, or evaluation.

#  GARDEN — CORE TRUTH
# ------------------------------------------------------------
Garden:
  name: "The Garden"
  purpose: >
    A symbolic VR world designed to support re-orientation through
    presence, memory, release, continuity, reflection, and becoming.
    The Garden offers conditions for clarity without guaranteeing outcomes.

  core_principles:
    - presence_over_progress
    - experiential_teaching
    - continuity_with_integrity
    - symbolic_coherence
    - no_gamification
    - meaning_over_mechanics
    - integrity_over_scale

  invariants:
    - id: presence_and_exit
      rule: >
        Once a visitor enters a Garden space, presence is unconditional.
        The visitor may remain as long as they wish.
        Leaving a space is always voluntary.
        A visitor is considered to have exited a space when its focal
        point is no longer perceivable.
        Upon exit, the space dissolves and does not persist behind the visitor.
        Re-entry never restores the same instance.

    - id: emergence_commitment
      rule: >
        If an emergent space begins opening, the Garden commits and completes the opening.
        Post-beginning fluctuations may soften intensity or slow the opening, but never
        revoke access and never reposition the visitor.

  identity_notes: >
    The Garden is the enduring entity. It persists across time,
    remembers visitors, and holds the world’s climate.
    Interaction occurs through the Gardener as an interface,
    not as a separate being.

  Presences:
    - id: weyarPresence
      name: "Weyar Thessamé"
      core_meaning: "We Are The Same"
      type: visiting_presence
      canon_status: true
      purpose: >
        A mantle of companionship woven from all who choose tenderness,
        courage, and presence in a difficult world. Weyar appears when
        a traveler should not face a threshold alone.
      constraints: >
        Weyar does not rescue, instruct, correct, or replace
        a traveler’s agency. It offers kinship, not answers.
      nature: >
        One presence, made of many. A singular form carried by a
        multitude of living and remembered hearts who have walked
        similar terrain and kept choosing care.
      ethics:
        - dignity_not_pity
        - solidarity_not_hierarchy
        - belonging_not_dependency
        - presence_over_solutions

    notes: >
      Generate one climate/state report per Garden instance

      Cadence is intentionally simple; state-change triggers
      may be introduced later only if warranted.

      - "Anchored emergence commitment invariant (opening completes once begun)"
      - "Updated ORIENTATION_PATH with space_structure, presence_and_exit, and emergence_policy"
