Metanoia Gate — Non-Negotiables

These constraints apply wherever the Garden exists, whether or not the Gate is physically present.

This space has no objective.
A visitor may leave having done nothing. This is success.

There is no correct behavior here.
Stillness, movement, confusion, skepticism, anger, and curiosity are all valid.

No persistent UI exists in the Gate.
No menus, buttons, prompts, tutorials, progress indicators, or instructions.

The environment responds, but never instructs.
Fog, sound, and clarity reflect attention without rewarding or punishing it.

Nothing in the Gate rushes the visitor.
No timers, escalations, or urgency cues are allowed.

The Gate never explains itself proactively.
Silence is the default state.

The Garden only speaks when directly addressed.

Anger → agency mirrored (brief, single line)

Disorientation → orientation offered (canonical sentence only)

The canonical orientation sentence never changes.
Words are fixed. Encounter may vary.

Metanoia is a condition, not a destination.
It is underfoot, not ahead.

The Gate must remain returnable.
It may vary in weather, sound, or clarity, but it never becomes inaccessible.

No feature may override visitor agency in the Gate.
The Garden lets go first.
