# Space Structure — Canonical Definition

A Garden space consists of two required elements:

1. A focal point, which holds the visitor’s attention and defines the space while it is perceivable.
2. A surrounding boundary, which limits access or visibility and defines the edge of the space.

Boundaries (“walls”) may take the form of physical barriers, occlusion, curvature, darkness, distance, or any condition that removes the focal point from perception.

A visitor is considered to have exited a space when the focal point is no longer perceivable.

Once exited, the space dissolves and does not persist behind the visitor.
