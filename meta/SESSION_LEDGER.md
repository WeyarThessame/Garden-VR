# Garden-VR Session Ledger

## 2025-12-19 – Base Garden Status + User Offering Pattern

- Changes proposed:
  - Added `meta/BASE_STATUS.yaml` (global Garden ambient state definition).
  - Added `patterns/userOffering.pattern.yaml` (Rule of Offering / Form / Persistence).
- Conceptual impact:
  - The Garden now has a defined "climate of becoming" that lives beneath all scenes.
  - Visitors can eventually leave intentional symbolic markers ("offerings") that persist in spaces.
- Next implementation steps:
  - Wire BASE_STATUS into the engine's boot sequence.
  - Add a minimal "share_thought" interaction in one test scene.
