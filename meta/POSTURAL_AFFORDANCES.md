# Postural Affordances — Canonical Note

The Garden is three-dimensional and bodily.

Some spaces are composed around a focal point that is best met from a particular bodily posture.
This posture is never required, never instructed, and never evaluated.

The focal point is always visible and real regardless of posture.
Posture does not unlock or resolve the space.
It simply aligns the body with what the space is already offering.

On paths, the world remains ambient and generous without insistence.
Beauty may be present, but nothing is composed to hold attention for long.

In spaces, the world is composed.
Secondary motion quiets.
Visual noise recedes.
The focal point is unmistakable.

The Garden may offer surfaces, contours, or support that make certain postures feel natural:
standing, seated, reclined, lateral, or grounded.
The visitor may ignore these entirely.

Nothing in the Garden instructs the body.
Nothing withholds meaning.
The body chooses how fully it meets what is already there.
