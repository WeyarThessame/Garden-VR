description: >
  Global ambient state for the Garden-VR. This defines the underlying
  "climate of becoming" that all scenes inherit unless they explicitly override
  specific fields. It is not a mood toggle for the user; it is the Garden's
  own condition.

default_state: stillness

states:
  stillness:
    label: "Stillness — The Garden is Holding Breath"
    ambient_light_profile: soft_dawn
    motion_bias: slow
    soundbed_profile: distant_wind
    symbolic_priority:
      - reflection
      - memory
      - listening
    notes: >
      Used when the Garden is resting, integrating, or inviting quiet noticing.

  becoming:
    label: "Becoming — The Garden is Changing"
    ambient_light_profile: shifting_haze
    motion_bias: gentle_drift
    soundbed_profile: low_current
    symbolic_priority:
      - thresholds
      - choice
      - emergence
    notes: >
      Used when something is in process but not yet decided. Edges are softer,
      forms are slightly unfixed.

  tension:
    label: "Tension — The Garden Is Listening Hard"
    ambient_light_profile: high_contrast
    motion_bias: irregular
    soundbed_profile: taut_strings
    symbolic_priority:
      - boundary
      - truth
      - alignment
    notes: >
      Used when there is friction that wants attention. Not danger, but
      a pull toward honesty.

  fracture:
    label: "Fracture — The Garden Knows Something Must Be Faced"
    ambient_light_profile: cracked_light
    motion_bias: unstable
    soundbed_profile: broken_echoes
    symbolic_priority:
      - confrontation
      - shadow
      - decision
    notes: >
      Used sparingly. Reality feels less stable. Invites reckoning, not panic.

  renewal:
    label: "Renewal — Something Has Been Integrated"
    ambient_light_profile: warm_glow
    motion_bias: steady
    soundbed_profile: quiet_heart
    symbolic_priority:
      - gratitude
      - integration
      - continuity
    notes: >
      Used when a lesson / encounter has settled in. Ground feels more real.
