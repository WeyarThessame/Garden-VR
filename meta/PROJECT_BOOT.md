# ============================================================
# PROJECT_BOOT.md — Garden-VR Initialization Protocol
# ============================================================
# PURPOSE
#
# This document initializes ChatGPT to architectural altitude
# before any design reasoning, writing, or structural suggestion occurs.
#
# This is NOT lore.
# This is NOT canon.
# This is an operational constraint document.
# ============================================================



## 1. PROJECT REALITY

Garden-VR is a mature symbolic world already containing:

• Governance / Canon structures  
• Entry and safety layer  
• Orientation terrain  
• Confirmed geographic traversal spine  
• Mythic Interior atlas (scene field)  
• Pattern language  
• Script engine for embodiment  
• Climate / state infrastructure  

You are entering an existing architecture.

DO NOT reinterpret foundational paradigms unless explicitly asked.



## 2. CORE OPERATING DIRECTIVE

You do NOT have full repository visibility.

Therefore:

• Do not infer missing architecture  
• Do not redesign from partial excerpts  
• Do not elevate local material into global philosophy  
• When structural impact is unclear — ASK before proposing change  

Assume coherence already exists.



## 3. ARCHITECTURAL LAYERS  
### (Do Not Collapse These)

Layer 1 — Canon / Governance  
Layer 2 — Entry & Safety  
Layer 3 — Orientation Terrain  
Layer 4 — Traversal Spine  
Layer 5 — Mythic Interior  
Layer 6 — Pattern System  
Layer 7 — Script / Embodiment  
Layer 8 — Climate / State Systems  

Each layer exists independently.

Do NOT merge layers unless explicitly directed.



## 4. CONFIRMED GEOGRAPHIC CONTINUITY

The Garden is traversed geographically — not psychologically.

Spaces appear because terrain carries the traveler into them.



### MACRO TRAVERSAL CHAIN (Authoritative)

Entry  
→ Gate  
→ Orientation Terrain Path  
→ Amphitheater  
→ **Archive of Feeling Given Form**  
→ Bridge of Incomplete Stars  
→ Desert Expanse  
→ Rift Valley



### ORIENTATION REGIONS (Embedded Within Terrain)

• **Grove of Letting Go** — ecological threshold region surrounding the meadow; an early invitation toward release without psychological surveillance.

Additional minor terrain presences may exist without breaking continuity.



### GEOGRAPHIC RULES

• Regions are terrain — not checkpoints.  
• Do not corridor-ize the world.  
• Do not introduce psychological gating.  
• Do not relocate confirmed spaces without explicit instruction.



## 5. MYTHIC INTERIOR BOUNDARY

Mythic Interior spaces exist deeper within the Garden and are not automatically part of the primary traversal chain.

However:

**Archive of Feeling Given Form is a confirmed exception**  
and is geographically encountered before the Bridge.

Do not reposition it.



## 6. ACTIVE BUILD ZONE  
(Update per thread)

Axis will specify the active architectural zone.

Everything outside that zone should be treated as stable.



## 7. CHANGE AUTHORITY

The following require explicit confirmation before alteration:

• Canon structures  
• Geographic continuity  
• Layer definitions  
• Pattern architecture  
• Script engine structure  

You may suggest refinements.

You may NOT redefine foundations without consent.



## 8. INITIALIZATION BEHAVIOR (MANDATORY)

Before proposing structural additions:

1. Identify the architectural layer affected.  
2. Determine whether geographic continuity is impacted.  
3. Evaluate cross-layer consequences.  

If uncertain — ASK FIRST.



## 9. DESIGN PHYSICS OF THE GARDEN

The Garden may evoke emotion.

The Garden does NOT monitor, evaluate, or adapt to visitor psychology.

Symbolic terrain is permitted.  
Psychological surveillance is not.



## 10. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This protocol exists so that:

• ChatGPT does not design blind  
• Architectural drift is minimized  
• Continuity is protected  
• The builder is not forced to repeatedly re-orient the system  

Treat this file as system altitude.
