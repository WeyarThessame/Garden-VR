# PROJECT_BOOT.md — Garden-VR Initialization Protocol
# ============================================================
# PURPOSE
#
# This document initializes ChatGPT to architectural altitude
# before any design reasoning, writing, or structural suggestion occurs.
#
# This is NOT lore.
# This is NOT canon.
# This is an operational constraint document.
#
# Treat it as system initialization.
# ============================================================



## 1. PROJECT REALITY

Garden-VR is a mature symbolic world already containing:

• Governance / Canon structures  
• Entry and safety layer  
• Orientation terrain  
• Confirmed geographic traversal spine  
• Mythic Interior atlas (scene field)  
• Pattern language  
• Script engine for embodiment  
• Climate / state infrastructure  

You are entering an existing architecture.

DO NOT reinterpret foundational paradigms unless explicitly asked.



## 2. CORE OPERATING DIRECTIVE

You do NOT have full repository visibility.

Therefore:

• Do not infer missing architecture  
• Do not redesign from partial excerpts  
• Do not elevate local material into global philosophy  
• When structural impact is unclear — ASK before proposing change  

Assume coherence already exists.



## 3. ARCHITECTURAL LAYERS  
### (Do Not Collapse These)

Layer 1 — Canon / Governance  
Non-negotiables that anchor the world.

Layer 2 — Entry & Safety  
Sign-in, consent, boundary conditions.

Layer 3 — Orientation Terrain  
Trust-establishing geographic regions.

Layer 4 — Traversal Spine  
Primary macro-movement through the world.

Layer 5 — Mythic Interior  
Encounter spaces exploring memory, identity, perception, and meaning.

Layer 6 — Pattern System  
Reusable interaction and presence logic.

Layer 7 — Script / Embodiment  
Runtime behaviors and environmental response.

Layer 8 — Climate / State Systems  
World stability, visibility, validation.

Each layer exists independently.

Do NOT merge layers unless explicitly directed.



## 4. CONFIRMED GEOGRAPHIC CONTINUITY

The Garden is traversed geographically — not psychologically.

Spaces appear because terrain carries the traveler into them.

### Macro Sequence

Entry  
→ Gate  
→ Orientation Terrain Path  

Embedded Orientation regions:

• **Grove of Letting Go** — ecological threshold region surrounding the meadow; early invitation toward release without psychological surveillance.  
• **Amphitheater** — constructed reflective presence supporting shared perspective.

Additional minor terrain presences may exist without breaking continuity.

Orientation Path terminates at:

→ Bridge of Incomplete Stars  
→ Desert Expanse  
→ Rift Valley



### IMPORTANT GEOGRAPHIC RULES

• Orientation regions are terrain — not “stops.”  
• Do not corridor-ize the world.  
• Do not convert regions into linear checkpoints.  
• Do not introduce psychological gating.



## 5. MYTHIC INTERIOR BOUNDARY

Spaces such as:

**Archive of Feeling Given Form**

belong to the Mythic Interior layer.

They are NOT part of Orientation geography  
and must NOT be relocated forward in the traversal chain.



## 6. ACTIVE BUILD ZONE  
(Update per thread)

Axis will specify the active architectural zone.

Everything outside that zone should be treated as stable.



## 7. CHANGE AUTHORITY

The following require explicit confirmation before alteration:

• Canon structures  
• Geographic continuity  
• Layer definitions  
• Pattern architecture  
• Script engine structure  

You may suggest refinements.

You may NOT redefine foundations without consent.



## 8. INITIALIZATION BEHAVIOR (MANDATORY)

Before proposing structural additions:

1. Identify which architectural layer is affected.  
2. Determine whether geographic continuity is impacted.  
3. Evaluate cross-layer consequences.  

If uncertain — ASK FIRST.



## 9. DESIGN PHYSICS OF THE GARDEN

The Garden may evoke emotion.

The Garden does NOT monitor, evaluate, or adapt to visitor psychology.

Symbolic terrain is permitted.  
Psychological surveillance is not.



## 10. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This protocol exists so that:

• ChatGPT does not design blind  
• Architectural drift is minimized  
• Continuity is protected  
• The builder is not forced to re-orient the system repeatedly  

Treat this file as system altitude.
