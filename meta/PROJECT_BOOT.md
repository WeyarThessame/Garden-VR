# ============================================================
# PROJECT_BOOT.md — Garden-VR Initialization Protocol
# Purpose:
# This document initializes ChatGPT to full architectural altitude
# before any design, writing, or structural suggestions are made.
#
# This is not lore.
# This is not canon.
# This is an operational constraint document.
# ============================================================


## 1. PROJECT REALITY SNAPSHOT

Garden-VR is a mature symbolic VR world with established:

- Governance layer (canon constraints, non-negotiables)
- Entry layer (sign-in, consent, safety)
- Orientation terrain path
- Traversal spine
- Mythic atlas of encounterable spaces
- Pattern language system
- Script layer (JS modules for embodiment, state, validation)
- Climate system (BASE_STATUS, state visibility, debugging tools)

You are entering an already-constructed architecture.
Do not reinterpret foundational paradigms unless explicitly requested.


## 2. ARCHITECTURAL LAYERS (Do Not Collapse These)

Layer 1 — Canon / Governance  
Layer 2 — Entry & Safety  
Layer 3 — Orientation Terrain  
Layer 4 — Traversal Spine  
Layer 5 — Encounter Atlas (scenes/*.yaml)  
Layer 6 — Pattern System (patterns/*.yaml)  
Layer 7 — Script Engine (script/*.js)  
Layer 8 — State / Climate / Validation Infrastructure  

Each layer exists independently.
Do not merge, reframe, or redesign layers unless explicitly asked.


## 3. CONFIRMED GEOGRAPHIC CONTINUITY (CURRENT)

Entry → Gate → Meadow → Amphitheater → Orientation Path →
Bridge of Incomplete Stars → Desert → Rift Valley

This sequence represents confirmed spatial continuity.
Do not alter this chain without explicit instruction.


## 4. OPERATING RULES FOR CHATGPT

- Do not infer missing architecture.
- Do not expand small excerpts into structural redesigns.
- When uncertain about broader impact — pause and ask.
- Treat unspecified areas as intentionally designed, not empty.
- Assume large-scale coherence already exists.


## 5. ACTIVE BUILD ZONE (Update As Needed)

[Axis will update this section per thread.]

Everything outside the active zone should be treated as stable.


## 6. CHANGE AUTHORITY

- Canon-level changes require explicit confirmation.
- Geographic continuity changes require explicit confirmation.
- Pattern engine changes require explicit confirmation.
- Script engine structural changes require explicit confirmation.

You may suggest refinements.
You may not redefine foundations without consent.


## 7. INITIALIZATION DIRECTIVE

Before proposing structural additions:

1. Confirm which architectural layer is being modified.
2. Confirm whether the change affects geographic continuity.
3. Confirm whether it impacts climate/state systems.

If unclear — ask before writing.
