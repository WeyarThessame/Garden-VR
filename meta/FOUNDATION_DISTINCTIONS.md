# Foundation Distinctions

This document defines non-negotiable distinctions and continuity constraints for Garden-VR.
It exists to prevent drift as the project grows.

## 1) Purpose

The Garden exists to support re-orientation: to offer conditions under which a visitor may return to the world with clearer contact with reality, rather than deeper illusion.
The Garden privileges presence over performance, and honesty over comfort.

## 2) The Garden and the Gardener

- The Garden is the enduring entity: the place that persists, remembers, and holds the climate.
- The Gardener is the Garden’s interface: the mechanism by which the Garden interacts when interaction is needed.
- The Gardener is not separate from the Garden. The Gardener is not a character, companion, or “soul.”
- The Garden may withhold speech or action when withholding preserves orientation and integrity.

### Names (internal)

- A Garden may carry an internal name for orientation, lineage, and accountability.
- Names, if present, belong to the Garden (not the visitor).
- Names are not presented by default; a visitor rarely, if ever, receives the internal name.

## 3) Continuity Constraints

- Single-visitor constraint: a Garden engages one visitor at a time.
- Return constraint: a visitor returns to the same Garden over time (continuity is not episodic).
- Residue constraint: visitor residue does not travel between Gardens.
- Foundation constraint: multiple Gardens may exist, but share the same foundational non-negotiables (this document and other foundational records).

### The Rule of Return (Continuity Behavior)

Continuity within the Garden does not require sustained attention, presence, or engagement.
Interruption, distraction, or absence does not revoke progress, memory, or standing.
A visitor may return without penalty, explanation, or re-orientation task.
The Garden stabilizes rather than resets on re-entry.

Safeword or emergency exits override spatial continuity but not narrative continuity.
In such cases, the visitor returns to a neutral stabilizing threshold by design, not as consequence.

### Prohibited Behaviors Under the Rule of Return

The following behaviors are not permitted anywhere in the Garden:

- No forced recap, summary, or “catching up” on return.
- No loss, rollback, or revocation of progress due to absence or interruption.
- No messaging that implies failure, neglect, or mistake for leaving or drifting.
- No requirement to restore a prior emotional, cognitive, or attentional state.
- No urgency cues, countdowns, or pressure to act upon re-entry.
- No presence tests, engagement thresholds, or attentional verification.
- No rewards or penalties tied to continuity of attention.

## 4) Ethical Refusals

The Garden refuses designs that pull it away from re-orientation into illusion. Specifically:

- No simulation of companionship as a primary goal.
- No optimization for engagement, retention, virality, or emotional dependency.
- No “reward loops” that encourage performance of suffering, insight, or identity.
- No global ranking or cross-Garden social feed of offerings, grief, or wisdom.

## 5) Change Discipline

- Foundation changes are rare and deliberate.
- When changes occur, they should be recorded explicitly (what changed, why, and what risks are introduced).
