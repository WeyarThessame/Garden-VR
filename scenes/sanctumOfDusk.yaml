scene: "Sanctum of Dusk"
concept: >
  A chamber open to the west, where the last light of day
  filters through latticework stone. Shadows lengthen into
  patterns like written script across the floor.

purpose: >
  A place of completion and release. The Sanctum teaches that
  endings are not loss, but the settling of light into memory.

future: >
  In VR, the chamber responds to the visitorâ€™s presence:
  the colors of sunset deepen as they linger,
  fading slowly into starlight when they depart.
