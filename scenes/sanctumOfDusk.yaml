scene: "Sanctum of Dusk"
concept: >
  A chamber bathed in the last light of day.
  Shadows lengthen across its walls as night approaches.

purpose: >
  To honor endings as sacred.
  The Sanctum teaches that closure is not loss,
  but a passage into rest and renewal.

future: >
  In VR, visitors arrive as the sun sinks low.
  Colors shift from gold to deep indigo,
  and the chamber fills with evening soundsâ€”
  crickets, distant owls, soft winds.
  Sitting in stillness lets the darkness enfold gently.

designNotes:
  - Chamber opening westward toward sunset
  - Dynamic light fading from warm to cool tones
  - Ambient night sounds layered gradually
  - Atmosphere of peace and completion
