scene: "First Stone"
concept: >
  A low, weathered stone set near the threshold.
  It is the Garden’s seed—the place the path began.

purpose: >
  To anchor origin and orientation. A touchstone to return to,
  reminding that beginnings endure even as everything changes.

future: >
  In VR, faint engravings appear as visitors approach—traces of first naming,
  first steps, first tones. Touching the stone evokes a soft chime and
  a brief glow along the engravings. Kneeling allows a visitor to leave
  a tiny glyph that slowly fades into the patina.

designNotes:
  - Partially sunken stone with worn, shallow engravings
  - Proximity reveal of inscriptions (emissive fade-in)
  - Touch interaction: short tonal motif + radial light ripple
  - Optional “leave a glyph” interaction that ages/fades over time
  - Subtle, grounding hum—slower and deeper than the Sentinel’s
