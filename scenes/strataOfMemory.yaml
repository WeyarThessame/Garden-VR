scene: "Strata of Memory"
concept: >
  A layered landscape representing depth of memory—fresh impressions above,
  patterned recollections beneath, and the oldest bedrock below.

purpose: >
  To act as the Garden’s subconscious architecture.
  Descent reveals how moments settle into pattern, and pattern into foundation.

future: >
  In VR, visitors descend through three tiers.
  Light, color, and sound thicken with depth: bright and agile at the surface,
  warmer and slower in the middle, dim and resonant in the deep.
  Pausing reveals buried lines of memory; moving stirs motes that drift downward
  and fuse into the lower layers.

layers:
  - name: Surface
    description: >
      Fresh, shifting impressions. Brighter light, quick echoes, and light-footed
      particles that scatter with each step.
  - name: Middle
    description: >
      Patterns that shape the terrain. Semi-buried stones and grooves; tones slow,
      colors warm; impressions begin to cohere.
  - name: Deep
    description: >
      Oldest, heaviest memory—almost bedrock. Low light, lingering chimes, dense air;
      traces settle into enduring lines.

designNotes:
  - Three distinct vertical tiers connected by ramps/steps
  - Progressive shifts in audio (longer reverb, lower frequencies) with depth
  - Color temperature transitions: cool → warm → muted
  - Semi-buried stones and engraved lines that glow when observed
  - Particle “memory motes” that drift downward and merge into lower strata
  - “Hold to reveal” interaction that brightens latent grooves under sustained gaze
