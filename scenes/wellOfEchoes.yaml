scene: "Well of Echoes"
concept: >
  A circular stone well, descending into darkness. When sound is made
  nearby, the well does not return the same voice—it answers with
  echoes from elsewhere, as if carrying memory from other times.

purpose: >
  A reminder that voices never vanish. Every word leaves a trace,
  and what is spoken may return in unexpected form.

future: >
  In VR, when a visitor speaks near the Well, the sound returns later,
  changed—shifted in tone, slowed, or layered with other voices
  left behind. Over time, the Well becomes a polyphony of memory.
