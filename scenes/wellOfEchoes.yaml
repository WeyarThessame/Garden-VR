scene: "Well of Echoes"
concept: >
  A deep stone well where voices return altered,
  carrying both memory and transformation.

purpose: >
  To reveal that what we send outward does not vanish—
  it returns, reshaped by distance and depth.
  The Well teaches that listening includes hearing ourselves again,
  differently.

future: >
  In VR, visitors can speak or make sound into the well.
  Their echoes return delayed, harmonized, or fragmented,
  sometimes layered with voices of past visitors.
  Dropping a token releases concentric waves of light
  that climb the well’s walls before fading.

designNotes:
  - Circular stone well, lined with glowing grooves
  - Depth emphasized with faint swirling light far below
  - Audio processing system: reverb, pitch shift, layering
  - Tokens or stones trigger expanding ripple animations
  - Occasional whispers of prior phrases surfacing faintly
  - Surrounding space dim and hushed, focusing attention inward
