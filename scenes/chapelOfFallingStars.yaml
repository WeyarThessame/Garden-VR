scene: "Chapel of Falling Stars"
concept: >
  An open-air sanctuary beneath a vast night sky.
  Shooting stars fall frequently overhead, their trails illuminating
  the space with fleeting brilliance.

purpose: >
  To evoke wonder in the brief and passing.
  The Chapel teaches that transience can be sacred,
  and that beauty need not endure to be meaningful.

future: >
  In VR, visitors stand within a ring of open arches.
  Stars streak overhead at unpredictable intervals,
  each fall accompanied by a soft chime.
  A visitorâ€™s presence increases the frequency slightly,
  as if attention itself draws the stars down.

designNotes:
  - Open stone arches forming a circular sanctuary
  - Dynamic skybox with randomized shooting stars
  - Light trails casting brief illuminations across the chapel floor
  - Soundscape: soft chimes layered with night air and distant echoes
  - Subtle interaction: more visitors present = more frequent stars
  - Optional gesture: placing a hand over heart summons a star sooner
