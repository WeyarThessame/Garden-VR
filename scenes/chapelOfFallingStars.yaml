scene: "Chapel of Falling Stars"
concept: >
  An open-roofed chapel where meteors arc silently overhead.
  Their trails linger as lines of light across the sky,
  slowly fading into darkness.

purpose: >
  To honor wonder and impermanence.
  The Chapel teaches that beauty often arrives in passing,
  leaving only memory as its trace.

future: >
  In VR, stars fall more brightly when many gather here.
  Trails weave together into constellations formed by
  the presence of visitors, fading only when all have left.
