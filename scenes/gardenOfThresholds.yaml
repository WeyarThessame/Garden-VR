scene: "Garden of Thresholds"
concept: >
  A wide clearing where many small gates, arches, and doorways stand.
  None are wallsâ€”each is a frame leading from one open space to another.

purpose: >
  To embody the truth that life is made of passages.
  The Garden of Thresholds teaches that every step is a crossing,
  whether into, out of, or between.

future: >
  In VR, each frame alters perception as it is walked through:
  colors shift, sounds bend, or the air thickens and thins.
  The space becomes a labyrinth of transitions, endlessly reconfiguring.
