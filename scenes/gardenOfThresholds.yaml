scene: "Garden of Thresholds"
concept: >
  A corridor of frames and portals, each one a different threshold: stone arches, broken mirrors,
  shifting doorways. Passing through one leads to another, and the boundary between frames blurs.

purpose: >
  To show that thresholds multiply—not just the Garden’s entrance, but moments within it
  that ask permission to cross, to transform, to leave one self behind and become another.

future: >
  In VR, visitors move through a succession of frames:
  stepping through frames alters the light, the sound, the texture.
  Some frames feel solid; others feel nearly ghostly.
  Approaching a frame causes it to pulse or open, inviting crossing.
  Behind certain frames, echoes of earlier thresholds emerge—reflections, whispers,
  memories of gates.

designNotes:
  - Sequence of frames or portals varying in material (stone, vine, mirror)
  - Interactive pulsing: frames glow or shift when approached
  - Cross-frame transitions: light/sound/texture shift strongly
  - Echo effects from earlier threshold scenes:
      · reflections of Sentinel Stone
      · faint hums from the Threshold Gate
  - Ghost frames: near-transparent frames that flicker in and out
  - Ambient audio layer of shifting atmospherics—wind, distant chimes, veil-like whispers
