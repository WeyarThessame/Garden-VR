scene: "Hall of Echoing Steps"
concept: >
  A long corridor of stone where each footstep resounds far longer
  than expected. The echoes overlap, weaving rhythms that linger
  long after the traveler has passed.

purpose: >
  To reveal that actions ripple outward beyond the moment.
  The Hall teaches that even small steps carry resonance
  in ways unseen.

future: >
  In VR, footsteps generate echoes that repeat and transform.
  The more visitors pass, the more layered the soundscape becomesâ€”
  a living rhythm built from countless crossings.
