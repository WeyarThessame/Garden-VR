scene: "Hall of Echoing Steps"
concept: >
  A long stone hall where every step multiplies,
  resonating far beyond the moment.

purpose: >
  To show that even the smallest actions linger.
  The Hall teaches that stillness holds memory,
  echoing what has passed through.

future: >
  In VR, footsteps resound differently depending on pace.
  Slow steps produce deep, singular echoes;
  quicker ones scatter into overlapping rhythms.
  Pausing lets the echoes fade into silence.

designNotes:
  - Elongated stone corridor with vaulted ceiling
  - Strong reverb effect tied to movement speed
  - Occasional harmonic overtones emerging from echoes
  - Dim lighting punctuated by pools of reflection on the floor
