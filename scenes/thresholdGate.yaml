scene: "Threshold Gate"
concept: >
  An archway of woven stone and vine, standing alone at the Garden’s edge.
  It does not block entry, but signals that crossing here carries weight.

purpose: >
  Marks the crossing between ordinary ground and the Garden’s realm.
  Reminds that thresholds are not walls—they are invitations
  to step with intention.

future: >
  In VR, the Gate shimmers faintly when approached.
  Passing through shifts the soundscape and light,
  signaling arrival into a different space.
  On leaving, it quiets—carrying the Garden’s echo outward.
