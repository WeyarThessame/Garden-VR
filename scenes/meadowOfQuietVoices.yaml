scene: "Meadow of Quiet Voices"
concept: >
  A wide meadow where grasses sway gently, carrying faint
  whispers that rise and fall like wind.

purpose: >
  To hold the subtler layers of togetherness.
  The Meadow teaches that communion can be quiet,
  woven from listening as much as speaking.

future: >
  In VR, as visitors walk the meadow, soft voices surfaceâ€”
  fragments of thought and memory, never overwhelming.
  Sitting still lets the voices settle into harmony with
  the sound of wind and grass.

designNotes:
  - Tall grasses shifting with subtle wind currents
  - Whispers woven into the ambient soundscape
  - Occasional clear words surfacing before fading back
  - Warm horizon light giving a sense of openness
