scene: "Meadow of Quiet Voices"
concept: >
  A wide meadow where the wind carries faint voices.
  They are never loud—more like whispers threading
  through the grass.

purpose: >
  To remind that community is often subtle,
  built of small exchanges woven together.
  The Meadow teaches that quiet connection
  can be stronger than loud declarations.

future: >
  In VR, voices emerge when visitors pause in the meadow.
  Sitting still reveals gentle fragments—laughter,
  sighs, unspoken words—woven with the breeze.
  The more who gather, the richer the chorus becomes.
