scene: "Sanctum of Dawn"
concept: >
  A circular chamber open to the east. At its heart rests a pool
  that catches the first rays of morning, scattering them
  across the walls in shifting colors.

purpose: >
  A place of renewal and beginning. The Sanctum teaches that
  every day carries its own genesis, and that dawn is less
  a moment than a promise.

future: >
  In VR, the chamber brightens only when the visitor faces east.
  The light grows as they remain, painting the walls with hues
  of gold, rose, and blueâ€”each entrance a new sunrise.
