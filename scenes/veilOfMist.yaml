scene: "Veil of Mist"
concept: >
  A drifting curtain of mist that hangs across part of the path.
  Shapes are blurred, sounds muffled, and distance feels uncertain
  until one steps through.

purpose: >
  Serves as a passage of unknowing. The Veil reminds that clarity
  often lies beyond confusion, and that walking forward through
  uncertainty is itself an act of trust.

future: >
  In VR, the mist thickens or thins depending on pace.
  Move slowly and outlines sharpen; rush forward and all dissolves
  into white haze. Emerging on the other side restores clarity,
  but not without change.
