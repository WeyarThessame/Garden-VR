scene: "Hollow Star"
concept: >
  A darkened star suspended above the path. Its shell is empty,
  light absent, yet it pulls the gaze and steadies the heart.

purpose: >
  A place to rest in stillness. To remember that emptiness
  is not absence but space for becoming.

future: >
  In VR, the star glows faintly only when a visitor stands
  beneath it without moving. The longer the pause, the brighter
  the inner shimmer. A reward for stillness.
