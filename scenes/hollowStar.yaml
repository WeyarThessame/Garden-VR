scene: "Hollow Star"
concept: >
  A vast, crystalline star suspended above, but its center is empty.
  Light gathers along its edges, leaving the core as a silent void.

purpose: >
  To embody paradoxâ€”the brilliance of presence alongside the emptiness within.
  The Hollow Star teaches that what seems missing can be as powerful as what shines.

future: >
  In VR, visitors can walk beneath the star and feel beams of light
  pass through them. Gazing into its hollow center stirs a sense
  of awe, loss, and possibility all at once.

designNotes:
  - Star-shaped crystalline structure, hollow at the core
  - Light refracting sharply along the edges, shadows within
  - Subtle hum, shifting tones as visitors move
  - Vast night-sky backdrop, emphasizing scale and silence
