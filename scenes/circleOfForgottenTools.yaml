scene: "Circle of Forgotten Tools"
concept: >
  A ring of worn tools half-buried in the soilâ€”hammers, chisels,
  plows, brushes. None are broken, only set aside, their handles
  smoothed by long use.

purpose: >
  Honors the labor of the past. The Circle teaches that every craft,
  every effort leaves traces, and that even what is laid down
  continues to shape what comes next.

future: >
  In VR, visitors can lift the tools, but they dissolve into light
  when carried too far, returning to their circle.
  The more that gather here, the brighter the ring glows,
  as if memory itself fuels its fire.
