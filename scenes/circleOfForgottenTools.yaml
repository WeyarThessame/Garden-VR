scene: "Circle of Forgotten Tools"
concept: >
  A quiet ring of weathered tools—hammers, plows, chisels—arranged
  around a circle of earth. Each bears marks of long use, now stilled.

purpose: >
  To honor the labors of the past and those who worked before.
  The Circle reminds visitors that effort is never wasted;
  even when tools are laid down, their story remains.

future: >
  In VR, visitors can kneel among the tools and touch them.
  Each contact sparks a brief vision of the work once done—
  echoes of building, farming, or crafting that fade gently into silence.

designNotes:
  - Stone circle with old, rusted, or broken tools embedded in the ground
  - Subtle glows highlighting the worn edges of metal and wood
  - Soundscape of distant hammering, digging, or carving, softened with time
  - Earth in the circle center, ready for renewal or planting
