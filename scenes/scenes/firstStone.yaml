scene: "First Stone"
concept: >
  The initial marker of the Gardenâ€”simple, grounded, and enduring.
  It remembers where the path began.

purpose: >
  Serves as a root anchor, a reminder that every structure rises
  from a first step, a first placing of stone.

future: >
  In VR, this stone remains unchanging. A quiet landmark,
  always visible no matter how far the Garden grows.
