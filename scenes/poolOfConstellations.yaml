scene: "Pool of Constellations"
concept: >
  A deep basin where stars appear not above but within the water,
  as if the night sky has poured itself into the earth.

purpose: >
  To blur the line between above and below.
  The Pool teaches that the cosmos is not distantâ€”it runs through
  the same currents we walk upon.

future: >
  In VR, visitors can dip their hands into the pool.
  Constellations ripple and scatter, reforming in new patterns
  that hint at unseen stories.

designNotes:
  - Dark reflective water filled with shimmering starfields
  - Constellations shift subtly as visitors move
  - Touch interactions cause ripples of light across the surface
  - Quiet cosmic tones woven into the soundscape
