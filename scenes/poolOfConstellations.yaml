scene: "Pool of Constellations"
concept: >
  A deep pool whose surface is scattered with lights like stars.
  The constellations shift when gazed upon, forming new patterns
  with every visitor.

purpose: >
  To remind that stories of the sky are not fixed,
  but living arrangements shaped by perspective.
  The Pool teaches that meaning is always in motion.

future: >
  In VR, stars ripple across the waterâ€™s surface.
  Visitors can trace shapes with their hands, connecting points of light.
  Each traced constellation lingers for a time, then fades,
  making room for new stories to be drawn.
