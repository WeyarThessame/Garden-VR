concept: >
  A circular chamber where countless strands of light stretch
  from wall to wall, weaving a living tapestry that shifts
  with each new presence.

  action and presence tugs the weave, altering the whole.

  of light and sound that spread through the chamber.
  When multiple visitors interact at once, patterns emerge,
  revealing harmonies of movement and intention.
