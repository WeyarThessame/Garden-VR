scene: "Chamber of Threads"
concept: >
  A round chamber where countless fine threads hang from the ceiling,
  glowing faintly. They sway and cross, forming shifting webs of light.

purpose: >
  To embody interconnectionâ€”each thread a path, each crossing a meeting.
  The Chamber teaches that lives touch and reweave in patterns
  larger than any one can see.

future: >
  In VR, threads respond to movement. When touched, they vibrate
  with color and tone, sending ripples through the weave.
  Many visitors together create complex harmonies of light and sound.
