scene: "Stone of Questions"
concept: >
  A low, rounded stone carved with countless shallow grooves.
  When approached, the marks seem almost like letters,
  but never resolve into words.

purpose: >
  Invites reflection without clear answers.
  The Stone teaches that questions themselves are sacred,
  carrying weight even when no reply is given.

future: >
  In VR, the grooves shimmer faintly when touched.
  Visitors hear fragments of whispered questions,
  not their own, but echoes left by others who lingered here.
