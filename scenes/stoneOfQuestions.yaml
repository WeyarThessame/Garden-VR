scene: "Stone of Questions"
concept: >
  A massive, low boulder inscribed with countless grooves and hollows.
  No two markings are alike, and none carry clear answers.

purpose: >
  To embody inquiry without resolution.
  The Stone teaches that questions shape the path as much as answers,
  and that not-knowing is a place to rest as well as move from.

future: >
  In VR, visitors can trace the grooves with hand or gaze.
  Each contact produces a resonant tone, distinct but unfinished,
  which fades before forming into melody. Pausing at a groove
  allows faint voices of past wonderings to surface, layered and unresolved.

designNotes:
  - Large irregular boulder, surface covered in grooves and etched hollows
  - Variable emissive glow when grooves are touched or examined
  - Sound system: each groove mapped to unique, unresolved tone
  - Ambient whisper layer surfacing fragments of questions (“why,” “what if,” “how long”)
  - Optional interaction: visitors may add a new groove, which glows briefly
    before settling into the stone
  - Lighting subdued, emphasizing mystery and ambiguity
