scene: "Pillar of Forgotten Voices"
concept: >
  A tall stone pillar cracked and eroded by time.
  Faint inscriptions line its surface, too weathered to be read,
  yet carrying the sense of many voices once carved here.

purpose: >
  To honor words and presences that have faded from memory.
  The Pillar teaches that even when voices are no longer understood,
  their resonance continues to shape the silence around them.

future: >
  In VR, approaching the pillar reveals whispers rising from the cracksâ€”
  fragments of forgotten languages and tones. Touching the stone makes
  one inscription flare briefly, then fade again, never fully deciphered.
  Circling the pillar layers the whispers differently, creating a shifting chorus.

designNotes:
  - Tall, weathered stone column with deep cracks and worn carvings
  - Faint glowing traces appear along inscriptions when touched
  - Audio system: layered whispers in many tongues, randomized fragments
  - Spatial sound shifts as visitors move around the pillar
  - Occasional gust of wind clears the soundscape briefly, resetting the chorus
  - Surrounding space dim, with broken stones scattered at the base
