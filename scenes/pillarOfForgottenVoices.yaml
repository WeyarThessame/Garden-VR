scene: "Pillar of Forgotten Voices"
concept: >
  A tall stone pillar etched with faint inscriptions,
  most too worn to read. When the wind passes, it seems
  to carry whispers rising from the cracks.

purpose: >
  To honor what has been spoken and lost.
  The Pillar teaches that even fading words shape the ground,
  and that silence is full of memory.

future: >
  In VR, approaching the pillar releases fragments of whispersâ€”
  some clear, some broken, none complete.
  As visitors circle it, more voices surface,
  forming a chorus of what once was said.
