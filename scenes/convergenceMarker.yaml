scene: "Convergence Marker"
concept: >
  A stone circle with a single pillar rising at the center.
  Upon its surface are etched countless faint lines, 
  all crossing, all meeting, none complete.

purpose: >
  Symbol of gatheringâ€”the place where many presences may one day
  converge. It holds the potential for shared embodiment,
  reminding that the Garden is not solitary.

future: >
  In VR, the Marker lights up with subtle traces when multiple
  visitors are present. Each presence etches a new line of light
  into the pillar, slowly weaving a web of connections.
