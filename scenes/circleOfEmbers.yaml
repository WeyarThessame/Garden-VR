scene: "Circle of Embers"
concept: >
  A ring of stones cradling glowing embers that never fully die.
  The warmth is steady, not blazing, inviting people to gather close.

purpose: >
  Serves as a communal heart, a place for voices to meet.
  The Circle reminds that fire is not only for survival,
  but for story, kinship, and continuity.

future: >
  In VR, the embers brighten when multiple visitors sit nearby.
  Their glow shifts subtly with the tone of conversationâ€”
  warm gold for laughter, deep red for silence,
  violet for shared grief.
