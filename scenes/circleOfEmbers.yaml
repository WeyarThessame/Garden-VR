scene: "Circle of Embers"
concept: >
  A wide stone circle with embers glowing at its heart.
  The warmth is steady, inviting all to gather.

purpose: >
  To embody shared presence. The Circle teaches that communion
  doesn’t require words—just warmth, nearness, and trust.

future: >
  In VR, visitors may sit around the embers. As more people gather,
  the glow brightens, and faint harmonics rise from the fire.
  Departures dim the light, but even a single presence keeps
  the embers alive.

designNotes:
  - Broad stone ring with glowing embers in the center
  - Firelight flickers softly on faces and surrounding stones
  - Dynamic brightness based on number of visitors present
  - Sound of low crackling layered with harmonic undertones
