scene: "Bridge of Echoes"
concept: >
  A stone bridge spanning a narrow gorge. Each step upon it
  creates an echo that lingers longer than expected,
  as though the bridge itself remembers the passage.

purpose: >
  To remind that movement leaves resonance behind.
  The Bridge teaches that even the simplest crossing
  becomes part of the Gardenâ€™s song.

future: >
  In VR, footsteps generate layered echoes that follow a visitor
  until they leave the bridge. Over time, the echoes of many
  crossings accumulate, weaving a chorus of remembered steps.
