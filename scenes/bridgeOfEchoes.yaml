scene: "Bridge of Echoes"
concept: >
  A wide stone bridge arcing across a chasm, its surface smooth
  as though worn by countless steps. Each sound upon it multiplies,
  rebounding into the distance.

purpose: >
  To remind that every action reverberates beyond its moment.
  The Bridge teaches that what we do cannot be containedâ€”
  it carries outward, often farther than we imagine.

future: >
  In VR, footsteps and voices on the bridge will echo in layered tones.
  Some echoes grow faint, others swell unexpectedly, as if the bridge
  chooses which moments to amplify. Standing still allows the reverberations
  to merge into harmonic chords.

designNotes:
  - Broad stone bridge spanning a deep mist-filled chasm
  - Acoustic environment with rich, shifting echoes
  - Visual ripples in the air to accompany sound reverberations
  - Subtle glow in the stone that pulses with resonance
