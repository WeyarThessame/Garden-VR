scene: "Well of Starlight"
concept: >
  A deep well whose waters shimmer with constellations.
  Looking down feels like gazing into an endless night sky.

purpose: >
  To remind that depth and height mirror one another.
  The Well teaches that within every descent lies the reflection
  of the infinite above.

future: >
  In VR, stars ripple across the surface when approached.
  Dropping a pebble sends constellations scattering, reforming
  into new patterns. Each visitor leaves behind
  a subtle reshaping of the night.
