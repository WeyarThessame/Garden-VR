scene: "Well of Starlight"
concept: >
  A stone well that descends into darkness, yet its depths
  shimmer with threads of starlight rising upward.

purpose: >
  To remind visitors that light is not only above but also
  drawn from hidden depths. The Well teaches that what feels
  buried can still shine.

future: >
  In VR, visitors can lean over the well and watch stars swirl upward,
  forming constellations that drift into the night sky.
  Dropping a token into the well releases a new flare of light
  from the unseen depths.

designNotes:
  - Deep stone well with faint starlight shimmering within
  - Rising motes of light spiraling into the sky
  - Sound of distant chimes and echoes, as if from below
  - Interactive “drop” mechanic triggering bursts of starlight
