scene: "Cave of Embers"
concept: >
  A low cavern where embers glow faintly in the dark,
  scattered across the floor like fallen stars.
  The heat is gentle, never burning.

purpose: >
  A place of endurance and quiet strength.
  The Cave teaches that warmth can persist long after fire,
  sustaining those who enter with patience and calm.

future: >
  In VR, embers brighten when visitors gather near them.
  Touching one sends a ripple of light across the cavern,
  linking each ember into constellations that slowly fade.
