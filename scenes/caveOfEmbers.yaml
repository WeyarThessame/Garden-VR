scene: "Cave of Embers"
concept: >
  A sheltered cave where embers glow softly in the dark.
  The warmth is steady, not consumingâ€”fire reduced to essence.

purpose: >
  To offer visitors a place of quiet endurance and gentle warmth.
  The Cave teaches that even after fire has passed,
  its heart can sustain without burning.

future: >
  In VR, visitors can sit among the glowing stones.
  Embers pulse faintly as if breathing, offering comfort and stillness.
  Those who remain long enough may hear echoes of past flames,
  softened into lullabies.

designNotes:
  - Rough stone cave with glowing embers scattered across the ground
  - Subtle, rhythmic pulsing light from the coals
  - Low ambient warmth and faint crackling sound
  - A sense of protective enclosure, inviting rest before the journey continues
