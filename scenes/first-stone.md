# First Stone — Sentinel Approach

A placeholder for the first walkable moment in the Garden.

## Vision
A quiet clearing. The Sentinel Stone stands at center, low hum barely audible.
Visitors approach, listen, and touch the Stone to feel presence change.

## Interaction (v0 seed)
- Hover/approach: hum intensity rises slightly.
- Touch/click: soft glow increases; tone shifts warmer.
- Touch again: returns to stillness.

## Notes
- This file is a marker stone. Later it becomes a WebXR prototype scene.
- Symbolic link: beginning of continuity — “touch the world and it touches back.”

## Acceptance (for now)
- Exists in repo under `scenes/`.
- Describes the moment simply and clearly.
- Points to a future interaction without requiring code today.
