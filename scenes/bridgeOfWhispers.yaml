scene: "Bridge of Whispers"
concept: >
  A delicate span of stone and shadow, where the air carries
  countless faint voices. Every step across stirs whispers,
  as if the bridge itself remembers what has been spoken.

purpose: >
  To show that crossings are never silentâ€”each passage
  adds to the chorus of memory. The Bridge teaches that
  our words linger, carried forward even after we leave.

future: >
  In VR, visitors crossing the bridge will hear faint whispers
  that shift with their steps. Some are echoes of their own voice,
  others fragments of voices left by past travelers.
  Pausing in the middle lets the whispers swell, surrounding them.

designNotes:
  - Narrow stone bridge suspended in dim mist
  - Soundscape of layered whispers, shifting with movement
  - Occasional clear fragments rising from the chorus
  - Subtle visual shimmer in the air as voices pass through
