scene: "Bridge of Whispers"
concept: >
  A narrow bridge of stone arches, suspended over mist.
  As one walks, faint whispers rise from belowâ€”fragments
  of words too soft to catch in full.

purpose: >
  To remind that communication is often partial,
  and that even fragments can guide.
  The Bridge teaches listening beyond clarity.

future: >
  In VR, whispers follow the visitor across.
  Some are echoes of their own past words in the Garden,
  others are traces left by those who crossed before.
  Each traversal weaves new layers of voice into the mist.
