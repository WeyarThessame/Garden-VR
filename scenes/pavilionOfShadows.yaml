scene: "Pavilion of Shadows"
concept: >
  A wide canopy formed of woven branches where light is dimmed.
  Patterns of shadow shift constantly across the floor,
  like ungraspable handwriting.

purpose: >
  A place to sit with what cannot be seen clearly.
  The Pavilion teaches patience with ambiguity,
  and comfort within the half-known.

future: >
  In VR, shadows respond to the visitorâ€™s presence.
  When someone pauses, the patterns gather around them,
  forming faint outlines of possibilities before dissolving again.
