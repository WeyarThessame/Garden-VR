scene: "Pavilion of Shadows"
concept: >
  A quiet pavilion draped in shifting shadows.
  Light filters through latticework, never the same twice.

purpose: >
  To honor the unseen and unspoken.
  The Pavilion teaches that communion includes mysteryâ€”
  what cannot be fully known still belongs.

future: >
  In VR, visitors stepping inside experience light and shadow
  moving across their forms. Shapes of others appear only in part,
  half-seen or outlined, reminding that presence is never total.
  The shadows respond subtly to breath and movement.

designNotes:
  - Wooden or stone pavilion with open latticework
  - Dynamic play of light and shadow across surfaces
  - Figures glimpsed only partially, blending with shade
  - Ambient sound low and hushed, evoking reverence
