scene: "Sanctuary of Moss"
concept: >
  A low, sheltered space carpeted with thick green moss.
  Every surface is softened, holding moisture and quiet.

purpose: >
  To embody gentle renewal. The Sanctuary teaches that
  stillness can restore by cradling rather than climbing.

future: >
  In VR, visitors may kneel or lie upon the moss.
  Their weight leaves no markâ€”the moss springs back,
  offering comfort without judgment.
  Subtle droplets glimmer on leaves and stone.

designNotes:
  - Shaded hollow with moss-covered ground and walls
  - Soft textures inviting rest and contact
  - Ambient water drops and distant trickling
  - Light filtering through overhead canopy
