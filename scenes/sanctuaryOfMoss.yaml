scene: "Sanctuary of Moss"
concept: >
  A shaded hollow where every surface is carpeted in moss—
  stone, root, and fallen branch softened into green.
  The air is damp, cool, and deeply still.

purpose: >
  Offers rest and healing. The Sanctuary teaches that resilience
  can be gentle, that renewal often comes through softness
  rather than force.

future: >
  In VR, the moss responds to touch, glowing faintly beneath hands
  or footsteps. Remaining here gradually restores light
  to the visitor’s form, as if the Grove itself is lending strength.
