scene: "Archive of Feeling Given Form"
concept: >
  A quiet chamber where emotions take shape—stone, sound, or light.
  What is felt does not vanish; it becomes form, to be witnessed.

purpose: >
  Holds the community’s unspoken weight. A place to translate
  grief, joy, or confusion into something that can be carried together.

future: >
  In VR, visitors leave traces when they enter—shadows of voice,
  color-shifts, fragments of music. Over time the Archive fills,
  a living record of what hearts have brought into the Garden.

designNotes:
  - Chamber walls patterned with embedded forms (stone reliefs, light glyphs, sound echoes)
  - Visitor presence generates ambient shifts (color glow, faint tones, shadow impressions)
  - Interactive layering: each new trace overlaps but never erases the old
  - Atmosphere: hushed reverence, soft resonance, dim but warm lighting
  - Central plinth or pillar that accumulates the strongest traces over time
