scene: "Tower of Listening"
concept: >
  A slender tower of stone, open at the top, where sound gathers.
  Voices from across the Garden drift here, rising and fading
  like distant bells.

purpose: >
  Invites visitors to climb and simply listen. The Tower teaches
  that attention itself is an act of connectionâ€”that to hear
  is to be present with what is beyond oneself.

future: >
  In VR, faint echoes from other scenes are carried to the Tower.
  The higher one climbs, the clearer the whispers become.
  At the top, silence reigns, holding all sounds in suspension.
