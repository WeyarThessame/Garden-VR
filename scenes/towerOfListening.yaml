scene: "Tower of Listening"
concept: >
  A tall, narrow tower rising into silence.
  Within, every sound is amplified into clarity.

purpose: >
  To remind that listening is an ascent.
  The Tower teaches that stillness deepens
  the higher one climbs.

future: >
  In VR, visitors ascend a winding stair inside the tower.
  With each level, external sounds fade and subtler tones emergeâ€”
  the beating of wings, the echo of a single drop, the hush of breath.
  At the summit, silence is profound yet alive.

designNotes:
  - Tall vertical structure, interior spiral staircase
  - Sound design shifting gradually with elevation
  - Subtle glowing windows offering glimpses outward
  - Summit open to sky, bathed in quiet light
