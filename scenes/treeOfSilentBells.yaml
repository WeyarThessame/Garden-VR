scene: "Tree of Silent Bells"
concept: >
  A tall tree whose branches hold countless small bells.
  They sway and shimmer like silver fruit, yet make no sound
  unless truly listened to.

purpose: >
  A reminder that silence is not emptiness but potential.
  The Tree teaches that sound and meaning arise only
  when one gives full attention.

future: >
  In VR, the bells remain mute until a visitor lingers beneath them.
  Then faint tones emergeâ€”soft, layered, almost like breath.
  Each visitor hears a different harmony, unique to their presence.
