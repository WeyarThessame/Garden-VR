scene: "Tree of Silent Bells"
concept: >
  A great tree hung with countless small bells,
  each perfectly still until noticed.

purpose: >
  To teach that attention awakens resonance.
  Communion deepens when presence is given,
  not assumed.

future: >
  In VR, as visitors draw near or gaze upon a bell,
  it begins to sway gently and ring.
  Multiple visitors attending to different bells
  create a shifting chorus of tones.

designNotes:
  - Large tree with many hanging bells of varied size
  - Bells silent until activated by attention or proximity
  - Soft metallic tones, harmonizing when several ring together
  - Subtle glow around bells currently resonating
