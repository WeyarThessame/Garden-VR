scene: "Stair of Silent Ascension"
concept: >
  A long stairway rising into mist. Each step mutes sound more deeply,
  until only breath and heartbeat remain.

purpose: >
  Invites the traveler into stillness through effort.
  The Stair teaches that ascent is not always about reaching a height,
  but about deepening quiet with each step.

future: >
  In VR, sound dims progressively as one climbs.
  At the top, silence becomes complete, and the view opens suddenly
  into wide horizonâ€”revealed only through patient ascent.
