scene: "Stair of Silent Ascension"
concept: >
  A long stairway carved into stone, climbing upward
  without rails. Each step taken quiets the world
  a little more.

purpose: >
  To embody the deepening of silence through effort.
  The Stair teaches that stillness is not absence,
  but a space revealed by steady ascent.

future: >
  In VR, each step up the stair dims surrounding sounds.
  Near the top, visitors hear only their own breath and heartbeat.
  At the summit, silence opens into a wide horizon.

designNotes:
  - Stone stair ascending along a cliff face
  - Sound gradually reducing as altitude increases
  - Sparse landscape growing brighter with height
  - Horizon vista revealed at the top
