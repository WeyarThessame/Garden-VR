scene: "Pond of Forgotten Names"
concept: >
  A still pond whose surface is etched faintly with names.
  The letters drift and fade, dissolving back into ripples
  before they can be read.

purpose: >
  To honor forgetting as part of remembering.
  The Pond teaches that identity is fluid,
  and that release can be as sacred as memory.

future: >
  In VR, approaching the pond reveals glowing names across its surface.
  They shimmer briefly, then fade if one tries to focus on them.
  Tossing a pebble into the water creates a ripple that erases
  and renews the inscriptions.
