scene: "Pond of Forgotten Names"
concept: >
  A still pond whose surface carries faint inscriptionsâ€”
  names that appear, blur, and dissolve like mist.

purpose: >
  To honor memory slipping into silence.
  The Pond teaches that forgetting is part of the cycle,
  and that what fades still leaves a quiet trace.

future: >
  In VR, visitors leaning over the pond see shifting names
  ripple across the surface. Speaking a name aloud causes it
  to linger a little longer before fading. Dropping a stone
  produces rings that scatter the letters into fragments of light.

designNotes:
  - Dark reflective pond with faint glowing text drifting on the surface
  - Names written in many languages, blurred and dissolving over time
  - Interactive voice recognition: spoken words extend the life of a name
  - Ripple physics tied to both gestures and object drops
  - Ambient audio: low water tones and distant whispered syllables
  - Occasional glimmers beneath the surface hinting at names already lost
