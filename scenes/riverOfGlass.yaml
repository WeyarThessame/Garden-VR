scene: "River of Glass"
concept: >
  A flowing river whose surface gleams like crystal.
  It reflects everything above, yet fractures into shards
  when disturbed.

purpose: >
  To remind that endings are delicate and revealing.
  The River teaches that reflection can both clarify
  and break apart.

future: >
  In VR, visitors approaching the river see perfect
  reflections of sky and self. Touching the surface
  causes it to fracture briefly into glowing shards,
  which reform as the water flows on.
  Each crossing reshapes the reflection.

designNotes:
  - Wide river with glasslike, reflective surface
  - Dynamic shattering effect when touched
  - Shards dissolve back into flowing water
  - Ambient sound of moving water with crystalline tones
