scene: "River of Glass"
concept: >
  A narrow river that flows clear as crystal, its surface
  reflecting everything with sharp precision. Shards sometimes
  break free and drift like petals downstream.

purpose: >
  To remind that clarity is both beautiful and fragile.
  The River teaches that reflection can cut as well as illuminate.

future: >
  In VR, the river responds to approach: footsteps near the bank
  cause ripples of light, while thrown objects fracture
  the reflection into shifting patterns. Crossing it requires care,
  as the glassy surface trembles but does not shatter.
