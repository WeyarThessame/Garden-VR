scene: "The Garden Between"
concept: >
  A shifting glade that is not fully here or there. Light filters
  through as if from two suns, and paths seem to overlap without
  touching. It is both inside and outside the Garden at once.

purpose: >
  Serves as the threshold of thresholdsâ€”the place where memory,
  dream, and presence weave together. Here, the visitor feels
  the Garden as a living whole, not just its parts.

future: >
  In VR, the Garden Between bends perspective: paths overlap,
  landmarks echo, and visitors glimpse multiple versions of the Garden
  at once. It is a space of wonder and orientation, reminding
  that the Garden is larger than any single walk.
