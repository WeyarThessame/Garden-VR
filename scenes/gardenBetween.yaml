scene: "Garden Between"
concept: >
  A shifting expanse where all paths converge.
  Landmarks appear faintly, layered atop one another,
  as though time and space overlap.

purpose: >
  To embody continuance beyond closure.
  The Garden teaches that endings are only
  thresholds to new crossings.

future: >
  In VR, visitors stepping into the Garden Between
  see fragments of every stage—stones, groves, stars,
  bridges—flickering in and out of view.
  Moving slowly brings clarity; rushing makes
  the space dissolve into blur.

designNotes:
  - Layered landscape blending multiple Garden landmarks
  - Subtle phasing in and out of structures and lights
  - Soundscape weaving themes from all previous stages
  - Central clearing offering stillness amid shifting forms
