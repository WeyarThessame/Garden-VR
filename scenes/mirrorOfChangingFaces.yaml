scene: "Mirror of Changing Faces"
concept: >
  A tall mirror framed in silver and stone.
  Its surface never stays the same—faces appear,
  shift, and dissolve, blending self with others.

purpose: >
  To remind that identity is fluid.
  The Mirror teaches that closure comes not from
  fixing who we are, but from allowing change.

future: >
  In VR, visitors looking into the mirror see
  their own features merge with countless others—
  friends, strangers, ancestors, unknown futures.
  The surface ripples with each breath, never settling.

designNotes:
  - Large reflective surface with shifting overlays
  - Faces morphing subtly in response to proximity
  - Ripple and shimmer effects tied to breath or gaze
  - Ambient tone that swells as identities overlap
