scene: "Mirror of Changing Faces"
concept: >
  A tall, rippling mirror of silvered glass. It reflects the visitor,
  but the face is never fixed—features blur, shift, and transform
  into other visages.

purpose: >
  To remind that identity is fluid, not a single mask.
  The Mirror teaches that we are many selves across time,
  and that change is not loss but unfolding.

future: >
  In VR, the reflection shifts with each glance—sometimes older,
  sometimes younger, sometimes entirely other.
  The mirror responds differently for each visitor,
  a living reminder of becoming.
