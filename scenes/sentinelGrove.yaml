scene: "Sentinel Grove"
concept: >
  A stand of tall, ancient trees whose leaves shimmer faintly,
  as though remembering every presence that has passed among them.

purpose: >
  To embody living memory held in community.
  The Grove teaches that communion extends beyond people—
  the land itself remembers and shares.

future: >
  In VR, visitors walking among the trees will hear subtle chimes
  when leaves stir, each tone connected to memories left behind.
  Standing still allows the grove to “speak” more clearly,
  layering voices in harmony with the wind.

designNotes:
  - Towering trees with faintly luminous leaves
  - Subtle wind animations carrying shifting tones
  - Leaves glowing brighter where visitors linger
  - Atmosphere of reverence, balanced between silence and song
