scene: "Sentinel Grove"
concept: >
  A small stand of tall, dark trees encircling a clearing.
  Their leaves shift with unseen currents, whispering like voices.

purpose: >
  Acts as a living memory-bank. The Grove holds echoes of passages—
  fragments of words, tones of laughter, murmurs of grief—
  woven into the sound of its leaves.

future: >
  In VR, each visitor leaves behind a faint audio trace:
  a syllable, a breath, a hum. Over time the canopy becomes a chorus
  of all who have entered, subtle and layered, never the same twice.
