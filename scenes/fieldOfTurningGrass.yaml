scene: "Field of Turning Grass"
concept: >
  A vast meadow where every blade of grass shifts direction
  with the slightest breeze or movement, rippling in endless patterns.

purpose: >
  To embody influence both subtle and shared.
  The Field teaches that each presence leaves a mark,
  and that movements weave together into larger currents.

future: >
  In VR, visitors walking through the field see grass bend away
  or lean toward them, forming rippling waves that spread outward.
  When multiple visitors move together, the waves overlap,
  creating new shifting patterns of motion and light.

designNotes:
  - Expansive field of tall, responsive grass
  - Dynamic animation: ripples triggered by footsteps, gestures, or wind
  - Light catching on the tips, glowing briefly as waves pass
  - Ambient audio: layered rustling, tones rising with stronger waves
  - Cooperative interaction: multiple visitorsâ€™ motions generate complex interference patterns
