scene: "Field of Turning Grass"
concept: >
  An open field where tall grasses sway in shifting directions.
  At times they bend together, at others they cross and whirl
  like a restless sea.

purpose: >
  A reminder of change and influenceâ€”that even the smallest breeze
  alters the whole. The Field teaches interdependence,
  how countless motions weave one pattern.

future: >
  In VR, grasses ripple in response to footsteps and breath.
  When many visitors cross together, waves of motion converge,
  forming visible patterns across the field
  before fading back into randomness.
