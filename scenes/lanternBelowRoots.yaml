scene: "Lantern Below the Roots"
concept: >
  A faint light glows beneath tangled roots at the base of an ancient tree.
  The lantern is small, almost hidden, yet its glow reaches far in darkness.

purpose: >
  A symbol of guidance when all else seems obscured.
  It reminds that even the smallest flame can orient the traveler
  through confusion or despair.

future: >
  In VR, the lantern appears only when a visitor crouches or kneels,
  shifting perspective to see below the roots. Its glow brightens
  when approached with stillness, dimming if rushed past.
