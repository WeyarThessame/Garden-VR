scene: "Lantern Below Roots"
concept: >
  A small lantern glowing beneath the tangle of exposed roots.
  Its light is steady but hidden, found only by those who stoop low.

purpose: >
  To honor guidance that is subtle and easily overlooked.
  The Lantern teaches that not all illumination blazesâ€”
  some lights wait quietly, close to the ground.

future: >
  In VR, visitors must kneel or lower their gaze to notice the lantern.
  Its glow responds to presence, warming when observed.
  Touching it causes surrounding roots to shimmer briefly,
  revealing hidden paths before fading back into shadow.

designNotes:
  - Lantern nestled beneath twisting, gnarled roots
  - Soft golden glow, pulsing gently with proximity
  - Interactive shimmer effect spreading through roots on touch
  - Soundscape: faint hum layered with root-creak and soil-shift
  - Lighting intentionally low to encourage slow, deliberate discovery
