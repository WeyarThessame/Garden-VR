scene: "Library of Unwritten Books"
concept: >
  A quiet hall filled with shelves of blank volumes.
  Their spines bear no titles, yet when touched, faint impressions
  of untold stories rise on the pages.

purpose: >
  Holds the weight of all that might have been said.
  A reminder that silence and potential are as much a part
  of the human record as what is written.

future: >
  In VR, the books glow faintly when approached.
  Opening one reveals shifting fragments: words, images, or sounds
  drawn from the visitorâ€™s path through the Garden.
  No book is ever the same twice, yet all remain unwritten.
