scene: "Library of Unwritten"
concept: >
  A vast hall of shelves filled with blank books.
  Pages turn on their own, whispering with words that have
  not yet been spoken or recorded.

purpose: >
  To honor potential and silence.
  The Library teaches that communion is not only in what is said,
  but also in what waits to be born.

future: >
  In VR, visitors can lift books from the shelves.
  When opened, faint impressions appear—shapes of letters,
  fragments of memory or dream—before fading again to blankness.
  Each visitor may glimpse different stories.

designNotes:
  - Endless shelves stretching upward and outward
  - Books with blank or shifting pages
  - Soft rustling soundscape, punctuated by faint whispers
  - Dim, steady light as though from unseen lanterns
