scene: "Bridge of Dawn"
concept: >
  A radiant bridge of pale stone, glowing faintly as if lit
  from within. The horizon beyond it brightens with the first
  light of morning.

purpose: >
  To mark crossing as rebirth. The Bridge teaches that
  every passage leads into a new beginning, no matter
  how dark the night before.

future: >
  In VR, as visitors walk the bridge, the sky gradually
  shifts from night to dawn. Colors warm, shadows soften,
  and the horizon glows brighter with each step.
  At the far end, day fully arrives.

designNotes:
  - Bridge surface glowing with subtle inner light
  - Skybox transitions smoothly from starry night to dawn
  - Warm tones of pink, gold, and pale blue emerging
  - Gentle chorus of birdsong joining as light increases
