scene: "Tower of Forgotten Time"
concept: >
  A weathered stone tower rising out of the deep path.
  Its surfaces are scored with eroded notches and rings—marks of hours
  that once mattered and then slipped away.

purpose: >
  To make felt the accumulation of unattended moments.
  The Tower teaches that time is pattern more than ticking,
  and that what we notice changes how it passes.

future: >
  In VR, visitors climb an interior spiral. A sun-shaft moves across the walls,
  slow when they linger, quicker when they rush. Touching the worn notches
  reveals faint vignettes—footsteps, laughter, a breath—and then they fade.
  At the summit, wind and distant bells carry a sense of wide, layered time.

designNotes:
  - Exterior: cracked stone, soft moss in joints, hand-carved tally marks
  - Interior: spiral stair with worn steps; slits of light that sweep the walls
  - Light/time coupling: sunbeam pace subtly responds to visitor speed (linger = slower sweep)
  - Audio: a single distant bell at long intervals; fine ticking emerges only on close inspection
  - Interaction: gaze/hold on a notch surfaces a brief memory vignette (audio + faint light)
  - “Place a moment” action: visitor can add a tiny mark that gradually erodes over real time
  - Dust motes drifting in the sun-shaft; shadow lengthens/shortens with ascent/descent
  - Summit platform: sightlines that align toward Strata of Memory and Well of Echoes
