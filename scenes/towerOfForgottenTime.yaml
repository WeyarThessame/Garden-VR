scene: "Tower of Forgotten Time"
concept: >
  A crumbling tower with no clock, yet its stones seem worn
  by countless hours. Inside, stairways spiral upward,
  some broken, some whole.

purpose: >
  To honor the hours that pass unnoticed.
  The Tower teaches that time is not only measured in minutes,
  but in memory, erosion, and silence.

future: >
  In VR, the tower shifts subtly as one climbs.
  Steps sometimes repeat, walls flicker with faint shadows
  of past travelers. Reaching the top reveals no clock faceâ€”
  only open sky, where time itself dissolves.
