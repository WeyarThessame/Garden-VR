scene: "Black-Leafed Grove"
concept: >
  A stand of trees with leaves so dark they seem to drink the light.
  The grove is quiet, yet beauty lingers in its shadowed form.

purpose: >
  To honor the hidden beauty within darkness.
  The Grove teaches that not all growth is bright—
  some thrives in shadow, shaping balance and depth.

future: >
  In VR, visitors walk among the black leaves which shimmer faintly
  when touched by starlight. Moving through the grove alters
  the soundscape: hushed tones, faint chimes, low pulses.
  Sitting still allows the grove’s quiet to deepen, wrapping visitors
  in a soft, protective dark.

designNotes:
  - Tall trees with jet-black leaves that absorb most light
  - Occasional starlight glints along leaf edges
  - Interactive shimmer effect when visitors brush past branches
  - Ambient audio: layered low tones, rustles, and soft chimes
  - Subtle mist on the ground, adding depth and mystery
  - Contrast between deep shadow and rare, sharp sparkles of light
