scene: "Black-Leafed Grove"
concept: >
  A stand of trees with leaves so dark they swallow light.
  At first they appear lifeless, but in stillness they shimmer faintly,
  like night sky caught in foliage.

purpose: >
  A place of mystery and unease, reminding that not all beauty
  is comfortable. The Grove teaches that shadow and obscurity
  have their own truths.

future: >
  In VR, the Grove deepens shadows as visitors enter,
  muffling outside sound. When one lingers long enough,
  the leaves reveal constellations within their veins,
  mapping paths unseen elsewhere in the Garden.
