scene: "Chamber of Winds"
concept: >
  A hollowed stone chamber where currents of air swirl and sing.
  The walls resonate like flutes, carrying tones that shift
  with each movement inside.

purpose: >
  To make the unseen knownâ€”giving shape and sound to the invisible.
  Reminds that presence itself stirs the world, even without touch.

future: >
  In VR, the chamber responds to motion. A single visitor hears
  a soft whistle; two or more create layered harmonies.
  Stillness quiets the air, until only a faint breath remains.
