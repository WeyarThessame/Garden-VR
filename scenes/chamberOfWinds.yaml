scene: "Chamber of Winds"
concept: >
  A hollow chamber carved into stone, always open
  to shifting air. Invisible currents sing as they pass.

purpose: >
  To teach that listening includes what cannot be seen.
  The Chamber reveals that silence is full of movement,
  waiting to be heard.

future: >
  In VR, visitors entering the chamber will feel gusts stir.
  Each draft carries tones—flutes, low moans, sudden whistles—
  shifting with position and posture. Standing together blends
  the winds into chords.

designNotes:
  - Stone chamber with wide openings to sky and cliff
  - Dynamic wind soundscape tied to visitor movement
  - Visual motes of dust or leaves carried in gusts
  - Echoing acoustics that change with direction faced
