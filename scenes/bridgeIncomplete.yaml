scene: "Bridge Incomplete"
concept: >
  A span stretching across a wide chasm, its far side unfinished.
  Boards end in midair, ropes fray, wind moves freely through the gap.

purpose: >
  Reminds that the Garden is a work still becoming.
  To cross is to step into uncertainty, to trust where no path is finished.

future: >
  In VR, the bridge extends as a visitor walks, new planks appearing beneath
  each step. If they turn back, it haltsâ€”unfinished until another dares
  to continue. The void below hums with possibility, not threat.
