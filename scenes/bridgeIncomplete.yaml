scene: Bridge of Incomplete Stars
concept: >
  A crossing of scattered starlight fragments forming only beneath each step.
  Behind, the path dissolves back into darkness; ahead, constellations blur
  and shift, never fully drawn. Presence is the only ground.

purpose: >
  To embody the teaching of "being present in the Now."
  This bridge is the hinge between the Gardenâ€™s inward terrain (memory, feeling, release)
  and the outward terrain (community, earth, continuity).

mechanics:
  walkway:
    - Luminous tiles appear only as the traveler steps forward
    - Tiles dissolve behind after a delay, preventing backtracking
  constellations:
    - Star patterns shift with player position
    - Rushed movement = blurred stars
    - Pausing = clarity, constellations briefly sharpen
  audio:
    - Ambient star-hum throughout
    - Whispers surface: fragments of past Garden echoes
  companion:
    - At the far side, a presence appears
    - Line spoken: "The world is never finished. It steadies only when you stand in it. Stay present. That is enough."

exit_condition: >
  When the traveler steadies themselves at the far side,
  the Garden beyond coalesces back into solid form.
