scene: "Bridge Incomplete"
concept: >
  A vast stone bridge stretching out into mist, but broken midway.
  The far side is unseen, yet the unfinished span beckons.

purpose: >
  To embody longing and unfinished journeys.
  The Bridge teaches that incompletion itself has meaningâ€”
  it holds both the ache of what is missing and the hope of what may come.

future: >
  In VR, visitors can walk to the edge of the broken span.
  The air hums with possibility, and glimpses of the far side
  flicker faintly in the mist. The gap is uncrossable,
  yet the presence of the bridge invites courage.

designNotes:
  - Stonework detailed and weathered, ending abruptly in broken edges
  - Mist and light obscuring the far shore
  - Subtle hum that grows stronger near the edge
  - Occasional flickers of shapes or structures just out of reach
