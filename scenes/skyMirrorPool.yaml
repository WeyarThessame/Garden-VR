scene: "Sky Mirror Pool"
concept: >
  A still pool of water that reflects the sky with impossible clarity.
  Clouds drift above and within; sometimes stars appear even in daylight.

purpose: >
  To remind that perception is layered—the sky above,
  the reflection below, and the self caught between.
  A place for quiet recognition.

future: >
  In VR, the pool reflects not only the simulated sky,
  but fragments of the visitor’s own past paths in the Garden.
  Shapes or lights from earlier landmarks shimmer across its surface,
  interwoven with clouds and stars.
