scene: "Sky Mirror Pool"
concept: >
  A still pool of water reflecting the entire sky above.
  To look into it is to see both the heavens and oneself,
  as if the boundary between earth and sky has vanished.

purpose: >
  To invite reflection and perspective. The Pool teaches that
  the vastness above and the depths within are mirrors of each other.

future: >
  In VR, visitors can approach the pool and see their reflection
  overlaid with constellations. Subtle ripples form when they lean close,
  blending self and cosmos in shifting patterns.

designNotes:
  - Perfectly still water surface with dynamic sky reflection
  - Reflections of constellations shifting as the visitor moves
  - Occasional ripple effects that merge sky and self
  - Surrounding stones forming a quiet boundary for contemplation
