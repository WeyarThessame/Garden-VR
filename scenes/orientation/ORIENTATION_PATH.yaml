# ============================================================
#  ORIENTATION PATH — First Remembering Space
#
#  This space follows the Metanoia Gate.
#  It is where orientation emerges through movement,
#  attention, and gentle wandering.
#
#  No action here creates obligation.

role:
  description: >
    The Orientation Path allows the visitor to move freely
    through a vast, living ecology.
    The Garden begins to take shape through patterns of
    movement and attention, not through discovery.
    Interaction is permitted without permanence.
    Orientation matters; alteration does not.

relation_to_gate:
  prerequisite: METANOIA_GATE
  inherits_gate_climate: true
  distinction: >
    The Gate suspends consequence entirely.
    The Orientation Path allows gentle residue
    without demand, instruction, or accumulation.

space_structure:
  principle: >
    Every Garden space has a focal point and a surrounding boundary.
    Boundaries may be environmental, perceptual, or architectural.
    Boundaries need not be visible; they must functionally limit
    passage or perception.
  focal_point:
    required: true
    note: >
      In Orientation, focal points may be subtle (sound, light, terrain ease)
      or rare (emergent chambers/spaces). The path itself is not "the" focal;
      focality emerges locally.
