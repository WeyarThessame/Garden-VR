#  ORIENTATION PATH — First Remembering Space
#
#  This space follows the Metanoia Gate.
#  It is where orientation emerges through movement,
#  attention, and gentle wandering.

  description: >
    The Orientation Path allows the visitor to move freely
    through a vast, living ecology.
    The Garden begins to take shape through patterns of
    movement and attention, not through discovery.
    Interaction is permitted without permanence.
    Orientation matters; alteration does not.

  distinction: >
    The Gate suspends consequence entirely.
    The Orientation Path allows gentle residue
    without demand, instruction, or accumulation.

caretaker_note: >
  The Orientation Path must remain forgiving.
  It allows wandering without loss.
  Emotion may move the weather here,
  but it never reshapes the land.
  Nothing is asked.
  Nothing is taken.
