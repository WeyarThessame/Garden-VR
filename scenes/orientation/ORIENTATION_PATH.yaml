# ============================================================
#  ORIENTATION PATH — First Remembering Space
#
#  This space follows the Metanoia Gate.
#  It is where orientation emerges and the Garden
#  begins to take shape through movement and attention.
#
#  No action here creates obligation.

role:
  description: >
    The Orientation Path allows the visitor to move freely
    through a living ecology while the Garden begins to
    take shape through patterns of use.
    Interaction is permitted without permanence.
    Orientation matters; alteration does not.

  distinction: >
    The Gate suspends consequence.
    The Orientation Path allows residue without demand.

  Nothing is asked.
  Nothing is taken.
