scene: "Cave of Unfinished Songs"
concept: >
  A cavern carved smooth by time, its walls carrying fragments
  of melodies. No tune is ever whole; each fades before completion,
  leaving only suggestion.

purpose: >
  A space for incompletion and longing. The Cave teaches that
  not all expressions reach an end, and that beauty can dwell
  in what remains unfinished.

future: >
  In VR, sounds drift through the cave as visitors move.
  Pausing in certain alcoves reveals looping fragments,
  different for each traveler. With many present,
  the fragments weave togetherâ€”never finishing, always becoming.
