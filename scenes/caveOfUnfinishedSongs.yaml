scene: "Cave of Unfinished Songs"
concept: >
  A cavern where faint melodies drift through the air,
  none reaching their final note.

purpose: >
  To honor incompletion. The Cave teaches that
  not all songs resolve, and meaning can live
  within what remains unfinished.

future: >
  In VR, visitors hear fragments of melodies
  that shift with their movements.
  Humming along extends the songs slightly,
  but they always trail off into silence.

designNotes:
  - Deep cave with walls that shimmer faintly with sound
  - Melodies weaving in and out without resolution
  - Interactive hum mechanic: visitorsâ€™ voices influence the songs
  - Echoes carrying fragments farther into darkness
