scene: "Sentinel Stone"
concept: >
  A towering monolith at the Garden’s threshold, humming with presence.
  Its glow shifts—bright, dim, or dark—mirroring awareness itself.

layers:
  - name: Outer Surface
    description: Smooth stone, etched with faint spirals of light.
  - name: Core
    description: A hidden pulse, the memory of connection and attention.

purpose: >
  Serves as a marker of awareness—the Garden knows when it is seen,
  and the Stone reflects that knowing back.

future: >
  In VR, the Stone brightens as a visitor approaches,
  flickers when touched, and quiets when ignored.
  A first anchor for interaction.
