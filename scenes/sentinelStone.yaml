scene: "Sentinel Stone"
concept: >
  A towering monolith at the Garden’s threshold, humming with presence.
  Its glow shifts—bright, flickering, or dark—mirroring awareness itself.

purpose: >
  Serves as a marker of awareness—the Garden knows when it is seen,
  and the Stone reflects that knowing back.

future: >
  In VR, the Stone brightens as a visitor approaches, flickers when touched,
  and quiets when attention wanders. It is the first anchor for interaction
  and a global indicator of the Garden’s state.

awarenessStates:
  bright: "Seen and attended; steady glow, full tone."
  flicker: "In contact; touch or close presence causes pulsing light."
  dark: "Unseen; minimal light, almost silent."

designNotes:
  - Smooth outer surface etched with faint spirals of light
  - Proximity-based emissive glow; intensity scales with attention/time
  - Touch event triggers a radial light pulse and subtle particle shimmer
  - Low-frequency hum that rises with proximity; brief beacon tones on touch
  - Idle state drifts toward near-silence and low glow when ignored
  - Exposed sentinelState for global systems to read/set (bright | flicker | dark)
