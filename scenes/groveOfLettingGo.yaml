scene: "Grove of Letting Go"
concept: >
  A secluded grove where leaves fall endlessly, fading before they
  touch the ground. The air is heavy yet freeing, as if the trees
  themselves are exhaling what they no longer hold.

purpose: >
  A place for release—sorrow, anger, or burden may be set down here.
  The Grove teaches that letting go is not loss, but making space
  for what comes next.

  At the grove’s center stands the Mirror Tree—its bark reflective 
  like calm water. When you look at it, you don’t see your face exactly, 
  but everything you’ve been holding onto. The grudges that grew moss. 
  The griefs still tethered to names.

  The Mirror Tree wasn’t planned—it tends to appear when someone 
  hesitates before releasing. The grove seems to call it up as a 
  bridge between knowing and letting go. Its trunk looks like polished bark 
  until you get close; then it shimmers, not quite glass, not quite water. 
  What it shows isn’t your reflection, but the residue of what you carry—
  the memories you replay, the names that echo when you try to sleep. 
  Each one glows faintly within the bark’s surface, like fireflies trapped 
  in amber. When someone reaches out, the images don’t resist. They dissolve 
  at the touch, threads of light winding upward through the canopy. The tree 
  hums as it absorbs them, and the grove brightens slightly—
  as if the act of release nourishes it. Sometimes a leaf falls from its 
  branches afterward, bearing no light at all. Just emptiness, pure and 
  weightless. That’s the moment you know the letting go has taken.

future: >
  In VR, visitors can cast objects, words, or symbols into the air.
  Each offering drifts as a leaf, dissolves into light, and joins
  the endless fall. The more that is released, the clearer
  the grove becomes.

designNotes:
  - Gentle rain of luminous leaves that dissolve as they touch the ground
  - Subtle hums and whispers woven into the soundscape
  - Trees with branches bending low, inviting offerings
  - A soft path leading outward toward the Fountain of Returning
