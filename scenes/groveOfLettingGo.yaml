scene: "Grove of Letting Go"
concept: >
  A secluded grove where leaves fall endlessly, fading before they
  touch the ground. The air is heavy yet freeing, as if the trees
  themselves are exhaling what they no longer hold.

purpose: >
  A place for release—sorrow, anger, or burden may be set down here.
  The Grove teaches that letting go is not loss, but making space
  for what comes next.

  At the grove’s center stands the Mirror Tree—its bark reflective 
  like calm water. When you look at it, you don’t see your face exactly, 
  but everything you’ve been holding onto. The grudges that grew moss. 
  The griefs still tethered to names.

future: >
  In VR, visitors can cast objects, words, or symbols into the air.
  Each offering drifts as a leaf, dissolves into light, and joins
  the endless fall. The more that is released, the clearer
  the grove becomes.

designNotes:
  - Gentle rain of luminous leaves that dissolve as they touch the ground
  - Subtle hums and whispers woven into the soundscape
  - Trees with branches bending low, inviting offerings
  - A soft path leading outward toward the Fountain of Returning
