scene: "Grove of Letting Go"
concept: >
  A secluded grove where leaves fall endlessly, fading before they
  touch the ground. The air is heavy yet freeing, as if the trees
  themselves are exhaling what they no longer hold.

purpose: >
  A place for releaseâ€”sorrow, anger, or burden may be set down here.
  The Grove teaches that letting go is not loss, but making space
  for what comes next.

future: >
  In VR, visitors can cast objects, words, or symbols into the air.
  Each offering drifts as a leaf, dissolves into light, and joins
  the endless fall. The more that is released, the clearer
  the grove becomes.
