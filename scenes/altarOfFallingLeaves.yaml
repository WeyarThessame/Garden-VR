scene: "Altar of Falling Leaves"
concept: >
  A raised stone altar beneath towering trees.
  Leaves drift constantly down, carrying away whatever is placed upon it.

purpose: >
  To create a ritual site for surrender.
  The Altar teaches that offerings, burdens, or memories can be entrusted
  to cycles larger than ourselvesâ€”what is heavy can be lightened.

future: >
  In VR, visitors may place tokens, words, or gestures onto the altar.
  Leaves slowly cover and dissolve each offering, releasing faint light
  that drifts upward or into the earth. Over time, the ground around the
  altar grows luminous with what has been given.

designNotes:
  - Central altar stone, weathered and mossy
  - Continuous cascade of luminous leaves from unseen canopy
  - Offerings interact with falling leaves: gradual dissolving into glow
  - Soundscape: soft rustling layered with faint whispers of release
  - Subtle ambient light shifts warmer as more offerings are placed
  - Surrounding grove thick with trees, roots curling toward the altar
