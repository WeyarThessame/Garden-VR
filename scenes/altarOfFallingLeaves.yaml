scene: "Altar of Falling Leaves"
concept: >
  A flat stone altar beneath a great tree. Leaves drift down
  constantly, covering its surface before sliding away into the wind.

purpose: >
  A place for simple offerings and remembrance.
  The Altar teaches that what is laid down will not stay forever,
  yet the act of placing carries meaning.

future: >
  In VR, visitors can place tokens, words, or gestures onto the altar.
  Leaves cover them gradually, then carry them away.
  Each offering joins the endless cycle of release and renewal.
