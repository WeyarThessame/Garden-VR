scene: "Bridge of Seeds"
concept: >
  A narrow span woven of roots and seedpods, suspended across a stream.
  As visitors walk, some seeds break free, drifting into the current.

purpose: >
  To remind that every crossing plants something new.
  Movement itself scatters beginnings, even if the end is unseen.

future: >
  In VR, each step across the bridge releases glowing seed-shapes
  that drift on air or fall into water, sprouting faint lights
  where they land. Over time, paths of growth appear from the
  crossings of many visitors.
