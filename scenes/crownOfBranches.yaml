scene: "Crown of Branches"
concept: >
  High above, branches from many trees interlace into a living crown.
  Through the gaps, fragments of sky shine like jewels in a woven net.

purpose: >
  A reminder of interconnectionâ€”that many roots, rising separately,
  can join overhead to shelter and to frame the heavens together.

future: >
  In VR, the Crown shimmers subtly with changing time:
  dawn light filters gold, night scatters stars through the weave.
  When multiple visitors stand beneath it, the canopy glows brighter,
  acknowledging shared presence.
