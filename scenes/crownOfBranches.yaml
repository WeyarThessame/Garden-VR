scene: "Crown of Branches"
concept: >
  A high canopy where branches weave together into a vast crown-like form.
  Through its lattice, glimpses of sky shimmer, shifting with the wind.

purpose: >
  To show that many roots can meet above in shared form.
  The Crown teaches that what begins separately can interlace,
  creating shelter and beauty through union.

future: >
  In VR, visitors walk beneath the canopy.
  Light filters down in shifting patterns, and wind stirs
  the branches into song. Looking upward, the crown
  sometimes resembles constellations, reminding that
  growth on earth reflects the sky above.

designNotes:
  - Dense canopy of interwoven branches forming a crown shape
  - Dynamic lighting: dappled patterns moving across the ground
  - Audio: layered creaks, rustling leaves, and harmonic tones in wind
  - Occasional sky openings reveal constellations through the lattice
  - Subtle interaction: gazing upward brightens the crown faintly
  - Surrounding ground ringed with roots, suggesting the link to whatâ€™s below
