scene: "Crown of Ashes"
concept: >
  A circle of blackened stone where fire has burned itself out,
  leaving only ash that glows faintly in the wind.
  Above it, faint sparks trace a crown-shape in the night air.

purpose: >
  To honor endings as beginnings. What has burned away becomes soil
  for the future; the ash itself is crowned, reminding visitors that
  loss carries dignity and hidden renewal.

future: >
  In VR, visitors can kneel to gather ash in their hands.
  As they lift it, embers flare briefly, then drift upward to join the crown of sparks.
  Each gesture transforms grief into quiet beauty.

designNotes:
  - A stone ring filled with soft, glowing ash
  - Occasional ember flares rising and fading into the sky
  - A hovering crown-shape of sparks forming and dissolving overhead
  - Warm ambient hum with low undertones, evoking endings and persistence
