scene: "Altar of Falling Leaves"
concept: >
  A raised stone altar beneath towering trees.
  Leaves drift constantly down, carrying away whatever is placed upon the altar.

purpose: >
  To provide a ritual site where offerings—objects, words, or memories—
  are entrusted to the cycle of letting go.
  The altar teaches that even weighty burdens can be carried lightly by the world.

future: >
  In VR, visitors can place tokens onto the altar.
  Each offering is slowly covered by falling leaves until it disappears,
  the trees whispering as they receive what has been given.

designNotes:
  - Central stone altar, weathered and mossy
  - Endless cascade of leaves drifting from unseen canopy
  - Soft rustling sound, punctuated by whispers of release
  - Gentle glow as offerings dissolve beneath the leaves
