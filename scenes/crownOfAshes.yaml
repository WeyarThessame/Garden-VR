scene: "Crown of Ashes"
concept: >
  A ring of charred stones marking the remains of a great fire.
  In the center lies only ash, soft and gray, faintly warm to the touch.

purpose: >
  To honor endings and transformations through loss.
  The Crown teaches that what is burned is not destroyed,
  but returned to the cycle as memory and soil.

future: >
  In VR, faint embers glow within the ash when approached.
  If a visitor lingers, sparks rise briefly into the air,
  then fadeâ€”reminders of what once burned brightly.
