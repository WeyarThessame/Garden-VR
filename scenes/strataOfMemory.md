# Strata of Memory

Concept: A layered landscape representing depth of memory.  
- Surface Layer: Fresh, shifting impressions.  
- Middle Layer: Patterns that shape terrain, semi-buried stones.  
- Deep Layer: Oldest, heaviest, almost bedrock.  

Purpose: Acts as subconscious architecture of the Garden.  
Future: To be mirrored in VR as descending tiers (light â†’ dense).
