# Strata of Memory

**Concept**  
A layered landscape representing depth of memory.

**Layers**  
- Surface: Fresh, shifting impressions  
- Middle: Patterns that shape terrain, semi-buried stones  
- Deep: Oldest, heaviest, almost bedrock  

**Purpose**  
Acts as subconscious architecture of the Garden.

**Future**  
To be mirrored in VR as descending tiers (light â†’ dense).
