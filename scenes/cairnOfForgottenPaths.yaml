scene: "Cairn of Forgotten Paths"
concept: >
  A mound of stones stacked at a crossroads. Each stone carries
  the weight of a path not taken, a turn once possible but left behind.

purpose: >
  Honors the choices that shape the journey by their absence.
  The Cairn teaches that every path, even those unwalked,
  contributes to the shape of becoming.

future: >
  In VR, the Cairn grows as visitors approachâ€”new stones appearing,
  faintly marked with symbols. Touching one reveals a fleeting
  vision of an untaken path, then the mark fades back into stone.
