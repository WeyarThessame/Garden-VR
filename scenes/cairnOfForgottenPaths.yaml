scene: "Cairn of Forgotten Paths"
concept: >
  A mound of stones stacked at a crossroads,
  each stone representing a path once considered
  but not taken.

purpose: >
  To honor decisions that shaped the present by absence.
  The Cairn teaches that forgotten paths still
  carry weight, even if unseen.

future: >
  In VR, visitors may place stones on the cairn.
  Each new stone releases a faint glow that drifts outward,
  briefly revealing a ghostly path before fading into mist.
  The more stones added, the brighter the cairn becomes.

designNotes:
  - Stone mound at the meeting of faint trails
  - Subtle glow rising from newly placed stones
  - Ghostly outlines of alternate paths fading in and out
  - Soft sound of shifting gravel and distant footsteps
