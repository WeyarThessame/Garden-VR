scene: "Obsidian Gate"
concept: >
  A tall gate carved of black glassy stone. Its surface reflects
  the traveler, but only in fragmentsâ€”never whole.

purpose: >
  A passage that tests self-perception. The Gate teaches that
  to cross into deeper places requires facing fractured images
  of the self.

future: >
  In VR, the Gate reflects visitors in broken shards of light.
  Crossing through causes the fragments to swirl and reassemble,
  hinting at new forms. Each passage feels different, as if the
  Gate shows a new facet every time.
