scene: "Obsidian Gate"
concept: >
  A portal framed in black stone, its surface polished and dark as obsidian.
  It reflects the visitor’s shadow but distorts it—fractured, mirrored, strange.

purpose: >
  To show that thresholds are not only about entry, but about confrontation:
  facing the self in the mirror of dark reflection, recognizing what one carries.

future: >
  In VR, visitors approaching the Gate see their reflection in the obsidian surface.
  Shadows stretch across the polished stone; as one steps through, light fractures
  and recombines, warping perception. Touching the edge triggers a ripple of distorted
  reflections outward, and whispered voices—echoes from past thresholds.

designNotes:
  - Highly reflective obsidian-like surface, smooth and mirror-finishing
  - Distortion effects: slight warping of reflection depending on angle
  - Ripple animation on touch or crossing threshold
  - Soft echoing sounds layered beneath voice-like whispers
  - Lighting contrast: sharp light on the visitor, deep dark reflective zones around
  - Subtle glow along carved edges or fractal lines to suggest fissures
