scene: "Bridge of Incomplete Stars"
concept: >
  A fragile span of stone and light rising toward the night sky.
  Its surface glimmers with starlight, yet the bridge stops short,
  dissolving into the air.

purpose: >
  To embody striving without arrival.
  The Bridge teaches that reaching toward the infinite
  is itself the journey, not the end.

future: >
  In VR, each step forward makes new fragments of the bridge appear,
  glowing briefly before fading. The further one walks,
  the more the stars themselves seem to draw nearer,
  though the far side is never reached.
