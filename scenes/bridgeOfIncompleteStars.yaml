scene: Bridge of Incomplete Stars
concept: >
  A fragile span of scattered starlight, fragments forming only beneath each step. 
  Behind, the path dissolves into constellations undone; ahead, stars blur like light through moving glass. 
  The future cannot be pinned down until one pauses and allows the present to form.

purpose: >
  To embody the teaching of presence. The Bridge teaches that the past cannot be walked again, 
  the future is indeterminate, and only the Now solidifies the world. 
  It serves as the hinge between the Garden’s inward journey (memory, feeling, release) 
  and the outward terrain (community, continuity, earth).

interaction:
  - Stepping forward creates a glowing star tile (present).
  - Each tile fades quickly, dissolving into darkness (past).
  - Stars ahead shimmer and distort, impossible to see clearly until the walker pauses (future).
  - Pausing allows the next fragment to resolve beneath the traveler’s feet, forming the way.

feel:
  light: >
    Star-tiles glow faintly underfoot, then dissolve into scattered fragments. 
    Ahead, constellations waver, blurred like glass. 
    Only when stillness comes do they sharpen into the next step.
  sound: >
    A soft chime with each tile’s birth. 
    When pausing, a low hum steadies, as if the world itself is waiting.

threshold: >
  The Bridge does not complete behind; fragments fall back into void. 
  At the far side, a companion presence appears and speaks: 
  "The world is never finished. It steadies only when you stand in it. Stay present. That is enough."

design_notes:
  - Walkway tiles appear only underfoot, fade after a moment.
  - Rushing forward causes the way to blur.
  - Stillness is required for the path to form ahead.
  - Placement: between the inner terrain of memory and the outer terrain of shared life.
