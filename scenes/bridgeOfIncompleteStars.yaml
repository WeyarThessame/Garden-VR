scene: "Bridge of Incomplete Stars"
concept: >
  A fragile span made of scattered points of light,
  like a constellation half-drawn across the void.
  The bridge does not reach its far side.

purpose: >
  To embody striving without arrival.
  The Bridge teaches that some crossings remain unfinished,
  and that longing itself is part of the path.

future: >
  In VR, visitors step onto glowing points that appear beneath their feet.
  Each step sparks a brief constellation, but the bridge never extends far enough
  to complete the crossing. Pausing causes the stars to dim, leaving only silence
  and the dark beyond.

designNotes:
  - Bridge formed of luminous star-points suspended in darkness
  - Steps generate temporary light connections (constellation lines)
  - Incomplete span: distant shore always visible but unreachable
  - Soundscape: faint chimes and deep void tones, shifting with each step
  - Stars fade behind the visitor, leaving no permanent trace
