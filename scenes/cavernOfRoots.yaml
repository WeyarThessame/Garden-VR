scene: "Cavern of Roots"
concept: >
  An underground chamber where immense roots twist and weave,
  forming natural columns and arches. Drops of water glimmer
  as they fall along the tangled wood.

purpose: >
  To remind that what is unseen sustains what is visible.
  The Cavern teaches that depth, foundation, and nourishment
  lie beneath every flourishing surface.

future: >
  In VR, roots glow faintly where touched, revealing veins of light
  that pulse downward into the soil. Sounds of dripping water
  shift with movement, as if the cavern itself breathes.
