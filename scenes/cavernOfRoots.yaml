scene: "Cavern of Roots"
concept: >
  A vast underground chamber where roots hang and weave
  like pillars, glowing faintly with the life they carry.

purpose: >
  To reveal the hidden nourishment beneath the surface.
  The Cavern teaches that what sustains is often unseen,
  stretching wide and deep to hold the Garden together.

future: >
  In VR, visitors walk among thick roots that respond subtly
  to touch or nearness. Some pulse with light, others hum
  like distant strings. Sitting still causes nearby roots
  to brighten, as though feeding from presence.

designNotes:
  - Large subterranean chamber with ceiling lost in darkness
  - Tangled roots hanging like pillars, some luminous
  - Ambient sound: low earthy resonance, faint water drips
  - Interactive roots pulse with light when touched
  - Occasional root clusters opening into alcoves for rest
  - Ground covered with soil and moss, soft to step on
