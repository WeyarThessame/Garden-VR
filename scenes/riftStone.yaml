scene: "Riftstone"
concept: >
  A broken monolith split down the center, edges glowing faintly.
  The crack hums with tension, as if holding two truths at once.

purpose: >
  To confront the visitor with division and ambiguity.
  A reminder that fracture itself can be a teacher.

future: >
  In VR, the Riftstone responds differently depending on approach:
  step to the left side and the glow deepens; to the right, it flickers.
  If touched directly in the crack, the sound of stone under strain
  echoes outward before fading into silence.
