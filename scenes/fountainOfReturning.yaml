scene: "Fountain of Returning Water"
concept: >
  A stone basin where water rises from hidden depths,
  spills outward, and then flows back underground.
  The sound is constant, but never the same twice.

purpose: >
  To embody cyclesâ€”loss and renewal, departure and return.
  A reminder that what leaves often comes back transformed.

future: >
  In VR, the fountain shifts its song based on who approaches.
  One visitor hears a gentle stream, another a rushing torrent.
  The flow never repeats exactly, teaching that return is
  always different from departure.
