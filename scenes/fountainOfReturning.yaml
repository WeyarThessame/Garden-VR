Scene: Fountain of Returning
Concept: >
  A clear spring where water arcs outward, only to flow back into its source.
  Each stream carries both liquid and light—flowing, dissolving into mist,
  then settling gently upon travelers as renewal. The cycle reminds visitors
  that what is released returns in transformed form.

Purpose: >
  To embody renewal through return—what is let go in the Grove reappears here,
  clarified, reshaped, and life-giving. The Fountain restores vitality, clarity,
  and belonging. To let go is to make space; here that space is filled with quiet strength.

Future: >
  In VR, visitors may cup their hands to drink from the fountain or step inside its mist.
  As they do, echoes of what they released earlier reappear as light within the water,
  carrying back a gentler form of what was surrendered. The more that is gathered,
  the more radiant the Fountain becomes, symbolizing shared renewal.

DesignNotes:
  - Continuous water cycle: flowing outward and back into itself, arcs of luminous streams.
  - Subtle mist and particle effects that dissolve into light upon touch.
  - Light shimmering through the water, revealing fragments of past offerings.
  - Ambient soundscape: gentle flow layered with soft chimes and low harmonic tones.
  - Pathways converging here from both the Grove of Letting Go and the Crown of Ashes.
