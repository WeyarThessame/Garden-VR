scene: "Fountain of Returning"
concept: >
  A clear spring where water arcs outward, only to flow back into its source.
  The cycle reminds visitors that what is released returns in transformed form.

purpose: >
  To embody renewal through returnâ€”what is let go in the Grove reappears here,
  clarified, reshaped, and life-giving.

future: >
  In VR, visitors may cup their hands to drink from the fountain.
  As they do, echoes of what they released earlier reappear as light within the water,
  carrying back a gentler form of what was surrendered.

designNotes:
  - Continuous water cycle, flowing outward and back into itself
  - Light shimmering through the water, revealing fragments of past offerings
  - Gentle sound of flowing water layered with soft chimes
  - Pathways converging here from both the Grove and the Crown of Ashes
