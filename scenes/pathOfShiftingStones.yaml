scene: "Path of Shifting Stones"
concept: >
  A trail paved with flat stones that rearrange themselves
  when not being watched. What was familiar becomes altered,
  urging attention to each step.

purpose: >
  Teaches impermanence. The path itself is never fixed,
  reminding that certainty is an illusion and presence
  is the only guide.

future: >
  In VR, stones slide subtly when the visitor looks away.
  Footsteps land true, but turning back reveals a changed pattern.
  No crossing of the path is ever the same twice.
