# Canon Alignment Declaration

Garden-VR implements and is constrained by Garden-Canon.

Current Canon Version:
ROOT CANON v1.1  
GARDEN CANON v1.0  
CONTINUITY PROTOCOL v1.0  

Implementation Rule:

If any implementation detail conflicts with Garden-Canon,
Canon prevails.

Garden-VR may extend the world,
but it may not contradict:

- Voluntary engagement
- Ecological honesty
- Non-psychological orientation
- Single-visitor presence
- Custodial continuity
- Depth over scale
- Reality anchoring

Before introducing new systems, run this test:

Would this change alter the structural nature of the Garden?

If yes → Canon review required.  
If no → Implementation may proceed.

Garden-VR is expression.  
Garden-Canon is constraint.
