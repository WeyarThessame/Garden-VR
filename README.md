# Garden-VR  

A symbolic VR world—The Garden—being grown in code and story.  

## Vision  
This is the first stone of The Garden, a symbolic world being built in code and story.  
Here we’ll gather scenes, lore, and interactions to grow the Garden into a shared space.  

## Structure  
- `docs/` → lore, scrolls, symbolic meaning  
- `scenes/` → WebXR prototypes and VR layouts  
- `assets/` → images, textures, 3D models (placeholders for now)  
- `scripts/` → interaction code for stones, thresholds, and landmarks  

## Next Steps  
1. Map key landmarks (Sentinel Stone, Archive of Feeling Given Form, Riftstone, Bridge Incomplete).  
2. Sketch placeholder WebXR scenes.  
3. Translate symbolic interactions into code triggers.
