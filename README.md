# Garden-VR

A symbolic VR world—**The Garden**—being grown in code and story.  
This repo holds the narrative seeds (YAML), interaction stubs (scripts),  
and supporting docs that together form a living metaphor.

---

## Structure

- **/scenes**  
  YAML descriptions of Garden landmarks.  
  Each file holds the `concept`, `purpose`, and `future` of a place.

- **/scenes/gardenPath.yaml**  
  The narrative spine—a suggested walk through the Garden’s stages.

- **/scripts**  
  Interaction stubs for VR behaviors (glow, hum, echoes, etc.).  
  Currently framework-agnostic; can be wired into Unity, Three.js, WebXR.

- **/docs** *(optional)*  
  Notes, diagrams, or supporting explanations.

---

## Current Progress

- 50+ landmarks seeded as YAML scenes.  
- Path scaffold (`gardenPath.yaml`) links them into a journey.  
- Interaction stub started for **sentinelStone.js**.  
- Folder READMEs added for clarity.

---

## Vision

The Garden is both a symbolic story and a future VR environment:  
a place to walk, reflect, and discover self and community.  
Every scene embodies a teaching—threshold, memory, release, reflection, communion.

---

## Next Steps

- Flesh out additional interaction stubs in `/scripts`.  
- Experiment with rendering a single scene in WebXR or Unity.  
- Invite others to explore and add their own landmarks.

*This repo is alive. Each commit is a seed,  
each file a stone in the Garden’s path.*
