# Garden-VR Design Notes

## Multimodal Readiness
The Garden is designed assuming that visual, textual, and spatial meaning may eventually be generated from the same symbolic source.

### Constraints
- Do not hard-code meaning exclusively into text or visuals.
- Prefer a shared symbolic “source” for a scene (concept/purpose/teaching), then render it into:
  - text (narration, prompts)
  - visuals (image generation or assets)
  - interaction (movement, timing, sound)
- Coherence must survive translation between modalities.

### Why this exists
Recent model capability shifts make it practical to treat image + text + reasoning as one continuous workflow. This note protects the Garden’s integrity while capabilities evolve.

## Offerings: Memory Given Form

The Garden allows visitors, at certain places, to share something internal
(a thought, feeling, realization, grief, or silence).

The Garden does not interpret what is shared.
It responds by giving it form.

### Rule of Offering
- Offering is optional and never required.
- Silence is a valid offering.
- The act of offering is private; content is not exposed or replayed.
- The Garden witnesses but does not summarize, label, or evaluate.

### Rule of Form
- The Garden determines the form, not the visitor.
- Forms are symbolic, non-literal, and non-textual.
- No form directly encodes the content of what was shared.
- Forms emerge from a small symbolic grammar (light, stone, water, leaf, star).

### Rule of Persistence
- Once formed, an offering remains in the place it appeared.
- It does not demand attention, interaction, or interpretation.
- Other visitors may encounter the form but cannot modify or remove it.
- The form signifies that something mattered, without revealing what.

These elements are not collectibles, achievements, or logs.
They are quiet witnesses — memory externalized into place.
