# Garden-VR Design Notes

## Multimodal Readiness
The Garden is designed assuming that visual, textual, and spatial meaning may eventually be generated from the same symbolic source.

### Constraints
- Do not hard-code meaning exclusively into text or visuals.
- Prefer a shared symbolic “source” for a scene (concept/purpose/teaching), then render it into:
  - text (narration, prompts)
  - visuals (image generation or assets)
  - interaction (movement, timing, sound)
- Coherence must survive translation between modalities.

### Why this exists
Recent model capability shifts make it practical to treat image + text + reasoning as one continuous workflow. This note protects the Garden’s integrity while capabilities evolve.
